"That's kind of me at work.

I work in IT and I do like what I do but there can be periods of major downtime. Since we're IT, we're kind of like ""emergency response"" but for people's tech issues. Sure there are ongoing projects that we need to do (updating computers, fixing servers, etc) but when there are no daily issues to solve for users or there aren't any major projects, we kind of just... sit and do nothing.

The thing is that my boss still wants us to do ""things"" even when there's nothing to do (I know, sounds counter intuitive because it is) He's not always in the office but when he is and I finished all my work, I kind of just pretend to be writing emails or making phone calls whenever he's around. Sometimes I sneak off to the electrical room and just be on my phone for a little while (it's not uncommon for us to be away from our desks for a long while as we do go to people directly for tech issues so it's not suspicious when I do this).","It can often be more tiring to pretend to work, than to work"

"I took over at a new duty station when I was in the Navy, and the girl I was replacing took a week teaching me everything she did. She had a daily routine of walking around to several nearby workshops and downloading data from a computer system at each separate office onto a3.5"" floppy (yes, this was back in the 90s).  Back at the desk, she would load the data from the floppies into a system on our computer.  It was some kind of tracking data that she sent somewhere (I don't remember all the details).  She had a whole routine of varying activities, and most of them involved waking around to other offices.  After she left and I took over, I followed her routine for about 3 days, then I asked the people in the offices if they knew what this data system was for; none of them did. I did some more research and asked more questions until I finally figured out it was an old system that they stopped using several years prior.  Nobody told her, so she kept on doing a job that would take her all day, even though it was completely unnecessary.  I started looking at everything else she was doing and absolutely zero of it was actual, necessary work.  She didn't care what she was doing, she just liked getting paid for walking around and talking to people all day.  That's literally all she did for three years.  Once I got rid of all her made up work, I figured out what the job was supposed to be and started doing that. I made Sailor of the Year at that command,  btw, and the job only took about 45 minutes each day to complete.","It can often be more tiring to pretend to work, than to work"

"The heart is a unique muscle that functions differently from the skeletal muscles you use when working out. It is composed of a specialized type of muscle tissue called cardiac muscle, which has several unique features that allow it to function continuously and efficiently.

Here are a few reasons why the heart doesn't experience the same problems as skeletal muscles during exercise:

1. Cardiac muscle cells are interconnected and work together in a coordinated manner, whereas skeletal muscles consist of individual fibers that are grouped together.

2. Cardiac muscle cells have more mitochondria than skeletal muscle cells, providing them with a higher energy supply. This allows the heart to function continuously without getting tired.

3. The heart has a unique ability to adapt its rate and force of contraction based on the body's demands. This means it can increase or decrease its workload to match the body's needs, preventing it from becoming overworked or fatigued.

4. The heart receives a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients through the coronary arteries, ensuring it has the resources necessary to function efficiently.

5. Cardiac muscle cells do not rely on anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid, a byproduct that contributes to muscle soreness and fatigue in skeletal muscles after intense exercise.

6. The heart has its own intrinsic rhythm and doesn't require external stimulation to contract. This allows it to beat continuously without becoming fatigued.

&#x200B;

Although the heart is a highly adaptable and efficient muscle, it is not immune to damage or disease. Prolonged stress, poor lifestyle choices, and certain medical conditions can lead to heart problems. It is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle and consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your heart health.",We’re very fortunate that the muscles in our hearts don’t get tired the same way the rest of our muscles do

Less than 2 weeks ago, I turned 18. Both my friends were 18 too. Based on my knowledge, we were all still virgins. This morning at school I asked my friends if we were gonna go through with our pact or chuck it in the bin. 

My friends looked at each other like they were debating who was gonna break the news. My female friend said she was no longer a virgin because she was sleeping with our male friend.

Life isn't an American Pie movie.,"TIFU when I suggested that my friends and I sleep togetherLast year my two friends (m & f) and I (m) made a pact to sleep together if none of us managed to get laid before we all turned 18. It was my suggestion. A joke at first, but underneath the humor we began to explore the idea. Call it too much HBO or pressure to be sexually active like most of our peers in high school. Less than 2 weeks ago, I turned 18. Both my friends were 18 too. Based on my knowledge, we were all still virgins. This morning at school I asked my friends if we were gonna go through with our pact or chuck it in the bin. 

My friends looked at each other like they were debating who was gonna break the news. My female friend said she was no longer a virgin because she was sleeping with our male friend. My male friend said the two of them had been hooking up since the pact was made. Both of them implied that the pact prompted the two of them to test how attracted they were to each other. I asked if it was too late for my test. My male friend put his arm around our female friend and said the purpose of the pact was to help virgins and they're not virgins. 

My female friend said the threesome would never have worked because we were too inexperienced. She begged me not to take it personally and said I was good at making her laugh whereas our male friend was good at making her orgasm. My male friend said he could do both before tickling our female friend until she laughed. His hands were all over her. Not gonna lie, it was uncomfortable to watch. If I knew the outcome of the pact would not only keep my virginity intact, but also turn me into the third wheel, I would've said nothing at all.

"""I asked if it was too late for my test.""

Jumped the shark right here for me, my friend. They both let you know they were together, and you STILL wanted to sleep with the both of them? And what would you want to do, exactly? Have sex with one of them while their now significant other watches?

"I need to ask this before it gets deleted by OP. Did you really think, inside your mind, that when you made this pact that it was a real thing? Like you were just going to bang your friends if you couldn’t get laid before you turned 18? This is what happens in the world you live in?

Secondly, you’re putting too much on yourself to do this. Aside from some weird, not typical circumstances, you’ll lose it. Just be patient and not focus on the act of losing your virginity.

basically gave bro a college course,"TIFU By not clarifying my son’s questions about sex partsThe other day I got an alert from my home network indicating that one of my boys had looked for “pron” on a computer at home. I determined that it was my oldest pretty quickly and took him aside and confronted him with it and told him I wasn’t mad, but that I didn’t want him looking at pornography on the Internet.

I told him that I would be more than happy to find some old girly magazines so he could look at them instead of looking at the high key gonzo crap that’s degrading our young men and women. He seemed to think that was a good idea and told me that he was really interested in how the holes worked and how the sex happened.

Well, this dad doesn’t shirk from responsibility. I proceeded to give him a lengthy discourse on the female undercarriage with accompanying pictures, I explained to him the various parts of the vagina, including the labia, the labia minora, and the clitoris and then had him explain back to me the different areas of a woman’s vagina and tell me what purposes they served. I showed him several pictures of different styles of women, including innies, outies, and a few in betweens. He’s a quick study, and was able to identify the pertinent parts of the vaginal area, even when I threw a curveball with a woman with either overdeveloped or underdeveloped labia minora.

So after I had shared my vast knowledge of women’s private parts, I asked my son whether he had any questions.

I was out working in my garage this morning. cleaning, Experimenting, normal spring cleaning. I had my music playing quite loud. And I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings. 

When my music paused I went over to my speaker to fix it. Then I felt a thing brush against my legs. I got spooked and turned around to find a cat.

No tag, no collar, and dirty enough to look like it was abandoned for a month. But it was surprisingly friendly, brushing on my legs, playing with my shoe string. 

I was concerned about how bad it looked so I took the cat inside. Placed the cat on my couch and let it do it's thing. Immediately it started purring, Then it just sat on my lap. 

I was happy to see a cat this friendly. But I needed to see if it was a stray, or a missing cat. Took a picture and posted it for my surrounding area.

No one replied, other than the ""aww she looks so cute!"" And they kept saying she so I assumed it was a girl.

Then I felt a kick, a big one too. I look at her belly and had seen that she was in fact pregnant. I knew i couldn't just take her to a shelter, so I'm keeping her with me for now.


TL;DR found a random cat this morning. Took her in to find out she is pregnant with God knows how many.

Edit: I took her to the vet just minutes after I posted this. She is rabies free, but not babies free. No microchip was found either.
They said that she has to be at least a year or two old because of how small she is. So now I feel bad for her.

Edit 2: Her new name is Ariel. As in the Disney princess because she has a weird thing going on with our feet. She sniffed them for a solid minute and did nothing else. That and she loves shoe laces so now I gotta hide any sort of string now.

UPDATE!! Look for the same name and title, all will be there."

"If you are willing and able to afford, you can feed her Royal Canin Mother And Babycat food, it's found at petco. It's specifically for pregnant and nursing mothers and for kittens 2-4months old. I've used this for my kittens and they grew up very healthy and with shiny coats. It has dha for healthy brain growth. 

And a pet fountain, my kittens love their pet fountain and it helps keep them hydrated and their pee isn't strong smelling because they are hydrated! 
Most cats are dehydrated because they are fed dry food, you can also moisten dry kibble with water before feeding. Cats tend to get kidney issues because they usually are dehydrated from eating dry kibble and not enough water.

I never knew that cats could have wet noses like a dog, but my kittens had dry noses when I got them and they are now wet because of the pet fountain. We also got it at petco for $30.

"That's because having those organs indicate a being as more dangerous because of their symbolism, a being with many eyes means that this being, theoretically speaking, will be more able to sense/detect more visual inputs, and some beings will be able to use them as weapon, say laser eyes, coming from our old understanding that the eyes project some kind of laser to see.

Mouths also have many indications, the being can be more dangerous because he can bite more, or if the being speaks, then maybe he has many 'evil spirits within him' and having many mouths indicate that this being maybe not alone.

On the other hand, nose have only two purposes, breathing and smelling, both of them require one or maybe two 'holes' to funtion properly. So having many of them won't necessarily give or indicate any advantage that being has over you.

Edit: for all the people bashing me about how important the sense of smell is, you guys literally missed my point, I never said anything about the importance of the smell itself, but how would having two extra snots or noses help you improve your sense? There are literally animals with thousands times more powerful noses than our and at the end of the day they still have ONE nose. Because for the sense of smell you only need an organ to pick up the chemical stuff in the air, and an organ to analyze said chemicals.

How long did it take before you farted in front of each other?,"TIFU by showering with the door closedLast night, actually.

My wife and I have always showered with the door open, ever since we started living together.

Recently, for reasons known only to them, our cats have become obsessed with the shower and started to come through the shower curtain while we're showering to pad around on the wet floor (our apartment is adapted to accommodate a wheelchair user, so there's nothing to climb over).

This wouldn't be so bad, but their paws get wet, and then they use the litter box, and they leave little white footprints all over the apartment.

The other thing about our shower is that the water takes a long time to get hot. Last night, I needed a shower, so I went into the bathroom, closed the door behind me, started the shower, and got naked. It was then that I realised I had another pressing matter to attend to - an imminent poop.

Now, to get too personal, but generally I prefer to poop before I shower, given the choice. The door was already closed, and the water wasn't hot yet, so why not take care of business now? So that's what I did.

I sat down and started the job. I was about a minute into the proceedings and not yet halfway done when my wife, thinking the closed door and running water meant I was in the shower, entered the bathroom to tell me something.

We locked eyes, and she looked appalled (at her intrusion, I think, it's not like she doesn't poop too). And to make it worse, while we were staring at each other...things were still happening down below.

In two and a half years of living together, we've seen each other in some compromising positions, but this was a new level of embarrassment for both of us.

After what was probably a second and a half, but felt like ten minutes, she disappeared and closed the door behind her.

We haven't talked about it, but I think we'll be knocking more often now.

Oh, and to make matters worse, I forgot to close the door once I was done showering, and one of the cats got in anyway!

Recently, for reasons known only to them, our cats have become obsessed with the shower and started to come through the shower curtain while we're showering to pad around on the wet floor (our apartment is adapted to accommodate a wheelchair user, so there's nothing to climb over).

This wouldn't be so bad, but their paws get wet, and then they use the litter box, and they leave little white footprints all over the apartment.

The other thing about our shower is that the water takes a long time to get hot. Last night, I needed a shower, so I went into the bathroom, closed the door behind me, started the shower, and got naked. It was then that I realised I had another pressing matter to attend to - an imminent poop.

Now, to get too personal, but generally I prefer to poop before I shower, given the choice. The door was already closed, and the water wasn't hot yet, so why not take care of business now? So that's what I did.

I sat down and started the job. I was about a minute into the proceedings and not yet halfway done when my wife, thinking the closed door and running water meant I was in the shower, entered the bathroom to tell me something.

We locked eyes, and she looked appalled (at her intrusion, I think, it's not like she doesn't poop too). And to make it worse, while we were staring at each other...things were still happening down below.

In two and a half years of living together, we've seen each other in some compromising positions, but this was a new level of embarrassment for both of us.

After what was probably a second and a half, but felt like ten minutes, she disappeared and closed the door behind her.

We haven't talked about it, but I think we'll be knocking more often now.

Oh, and to make matters worse, I forgot to close the door once I was done showering, and one of the cats got in anyway!

TL,DR; Closed the bathroom door to keep the cats out, ended up giving my wife a show she didn't want."
"It was embarrassing the first time me and my partner walked in on each other, but we were able to laugh about it. Occasionally I'll ask for TP and he will hand it thru the door lol.

I get home from grocery shopping and school and shes upstairs in her bed and she seems sad, but in like a stressed out way, which has been her normal lately. I figured id ask her what was wrong and she starts sobbing and says ""Nothing""

I call her out on her bullshit and she said that shes too embarrassed to tell me and keeps saying that she cant believe she's telling her 17 yro child this. 

She tells me that she bought a vibrator a year or so ago and its missing. She said that either my dad found it, got jealous and threw it away, or my 13yro sister found it in its hiding spot and took it. (the vibrator was put in an old clutch of my mom's and placed in a drawer in my parents bedroom. my sister has been wearing my moms shoes and going in and out of that drawer for the shoes, and she has a knack for stealing so that's why she would have it)

I dont judge her at all, but I'm in disbelief and my mom is sobbing, so i say that I'll go look for it before she goes to my dad about it. Either way she has a problem with an emotionally abusive jealous husband or an interesting talk with my unknowing sister.

I call her out on her bullshit and she said that shes too embarrassed to tell me and keeps saying that she cant believe she's telling her 17 yro child this. 

She tells me that she bought a vibrator a year or so ago and its missing. She said that either my dad found it, got jealous and threw it away, or my 13yro sister found it in its hiding spot and took it. (the vibrator was put in an old clutch of my mom's and placed in a drawer in my parents bedroom. my sister has been wearing my moms shoes and going in and out of that drawer for the shoes, and she has a knack for stealing so that's why she would have it)

I dont judge her at all, but I'm in disbelief and my mom is sobbing, so i say that I'll go look for it before she goes to my dad about it. Either way she has a problem with an emotionally abusive jealous husband or an interesting talk with my unknowing sister.

So here i am, looking for my moms vibrator through my sisters stuff. im sitting on my sister's bed right now trying to comprehend everything

TL;DR: I asked my mom what was wrong only to find out her vibrator is missing and now im looking for my moms vibrator

Edit: My dad didn't take it, nor is he mad/jealous....that only leaves my sister.....

Edit: I dont hate my dad. He has his his anger issues and has emotionally abused my family in the past, but he saved me and my mom.

"Sounds like you found a great dentist. Please keep going back every 6months so this doesnt repeat itself. I didn't see a dentist for a decade too, but after I was able to finally make an appointment a few years ago I am glad I did.","TIFU By not seeing a dentist for a decade with a broken tooth and finding something awful in the hole *UPDATE*[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1233tcq/tifu_by_not_seeing_a_dentist_for_a_decade_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

So I had my initial appointment about two weeks ago.  I absolutely cried my eyes out through the appointment as I was absolutely terrified.  The dentist held my hand and listened to my every word as I prattled on about trauma from previous dentists.

She looked inside my mouth and she told me everything she was going to do before she did it.  I had an Xray, and then we discussed what would happen next.

The dentist told me that my teeth were in surprisingly great condition considering I hadn't seen a dentist in so long, but the one broken tooth does need to come out.  She offered IV sedation, which I accepted.  We made an appointment for the following week.

I arrived at my appointment feeling awful.  My blood pressure and pulse were through the roof, I was breathing heavily and panicking.

The dentist sedated me, and apart from some small flashes of memory, I remember nothing until I woke up at home on the couch.

My broken tooth was removed, I have stitches in my gum, and it's all over.  It's all over.  She asked me if I'd feel comfortable visiting her for a check up at least once a year, and I agreed.

It's all over and I'm so relieved.

TL;DR: Didn't see the dentist for a decade with a broken tooth due to a severe phobia, pulled something gross out of the hole in my tooth, forced myself to visit the dentist.  Was sedated and had the tooth removed and it is all over.

Go to the dentist, guys!"
"As someone who also has anxiety at the dentist; I want to tell you it gets better.

I was similar; At my consultation I was crying, shaking, and think I broke the hygienist’s hand by gripping it so hard. Got *IV* sedation, with an full on anesthesiologist, for the first actual visit for several cavities and other fixes. I was in that chair 4 hours unconscious.

Now I go for a cleaning every three months and I’m down to just using nitrous for all dental visits.  I’ll probably never go to the dentist without some form of sedation, but it did get easier to bring myself to sit in that chair.

"Oh no, were they doing Bass to Mouth?","TIFU by accidentally clicking a fish porn link on google I was scrolling through Discord with my friend, trying to find something funny to send. I was feeling a bit mischievous, so I decided to search for something questionable and random, maybe a fish sucking on an ""eel"" that would represent a phallic object. I thought it would be hilarious to send to my friend, so I eagerly began my search. Without thinking, I clicked on the first link that popped up on Google. To my shock, it was a PORNHUB link to fish pornography. My heart dropped. I immediately tried to delete it, hoping to erase the evidence, but it was too late. My parents have an app that alerts them if I visit any adult website, and it gives them all the information about the URL. My mind raced as I imagined my parents getting a notification and thinking I was watching fish pornography. I'm not sure which would be worse, if they thought I was watching regular porn or fish porn. Either way, I knew I was in trouble. I confided in my friend about what had happened, hoping they could give me some advice. They suggested that I create a story saying that I was researching marine biology for a school project and accidentally stumbled upon the content.

So just hours ago I have taken in a stray cat whom I now call Ariel. She is pregnant and expecting soon.

Whilst I was running around and tidying up all of my stuff that could harm the cat. I found a sad discovery. I found a dead cat in my garage. And as soon as I opened the door to my house, Ariel came running in and straight to the body.

 He was skinny to where his ribs were showing greatly. She hovered over for a solid 10 minutes. Then she just walked away. 

I am about to bury the body in the backyard. But I would let Ariel get the last few minutes with her lover.

Since I have to add more words let's feed you all in on how Ariel is doing. That crackhead is CRAZY, She has been playing with my shoelaces and finding the best spot to observe the outside and inside all at once.

She has gotten both dry and wet food and a good amount of water, thanks to my grandma for giving me her cats old dry food gravity feeder 

Now I don't know how many kittens she will have and I'm going to leave it as so and go in blind. My roommates love her and want to keep her also.

Will I keep all the kittens? I'm not sure because it depends if it's a big litter. 

So thanks to all of you guys for helping out with advice and forcing me to ""pay the cat tax""

"Messaged you OP but just in case and as well as info for others that may have similar situations come up:

Hi there, I volunteer for cat rescues and have fostered plenty of cats and kittens.

With the kittens it is best to let the mom feed and take care of the kittens until they can be weened off which is usually 4-6 weeks old when some kitten wet food can be introduced.

**Just in case the mom does not take up to motherhood (it happens), you may want to have a cat rescue ready to take them in (so please call a few and let them know of the situation.)**

Taking care of neonatal kittens is really difficult if the mom is not feeding them.

They need.....

a)  special cat formula for there age (KMR or similar brands ) and need to be bottle fed every 2 hours.

b) As they are not able to urinate or defecate on there own they need to be stimulated to do so.

c)  neonate kittens  need to be kept warm so a plug-in heating pad would be needed (most auto turn off every 2 hours)- just don't set the neonate kittens directly on the pad.

d) be placed in a safe enclosure (cat carrier is fine)

**So if you are not able to handle the above, please make sure you have already contacted a rescue so they can make sure they have a foster on stand-by.  It is kitten season right now so a lot of rescues get inundated.**

Now if the mom, is motherly and takes care of the kittens, then should be easy... just keep an eye out in case of any runts get left behind as they will need the above mention care.","TIFU By bringing in a stray cat. UPDATEThis is the original post.

So just hours ago I have taken in a stray cat whom I now call Ariel. She is pregnant and expecting soon.

Whilst I was running around and tidying up all of my stuff that could harm the cat. I found a sad discovery. I found a dead cat in my garage. And as soon as I opened the door to my house, Ariel came running in and straight to the body.

 He was skinny to where his ribs were showing greatly. She hovered over for a solid 10 minutes. Then she just walked away. 

I am about to bury the body in the backyard. But I would let Ariel get the last few minutes with her lover.

Since I have to add more words let's feed you all in on how Ariel is doing. That crackhead is CRAZY, She has been playing with my shoelaces and finding the best spot to observe the outside and inside all at once.

She has gotten both dry and wet food and a good amount of water, thanks to my grandma for giving me her cats old dry food gravity feeder 

Now I don't know how many kittens she will have and I'm going to leave it as so and go in blind. My roommates love her and want to keep her also.

Will I keep all the kittens? I'm not sure because it depends if it's a big litter. 

So thanks to all of you guys for helping out with advice and forcing me to ""pay the cat tax"" 

TL;DR Found a cat, found it's dead lover. Learned I'm going to have kittens, and my wallet dented."

I woke up this morning expecting to have a relaxing day - instead, I was awoken to dozens of messages, calls....and a Facebook ban. Great. 

TL;DR after washing my hands I put my phone away and accidentally posted a photo of my anus to all of my friends and family on Facebook. And now I'm banned and everyone knows I have hemorrhoids."
Glad they took down the poke feature,"TIFU By posting a photo of my hemmorriods on FacebookWell, there's no point in making this anonymous since most of my friends and family already know.   


I've been dealing with a case of painful hemorrhoids that have tended to come and go over the years. This time, I wanted to do something about it because they have been affecting my quality of life (I travel for work). Anyway, I went to see my doctor and he gave me some cream - but it didn't help a ton.   


They produce a lot of blood and I've even had to go home once because there was a tiny bloodstain that seeped through my pants leaving a small bloodstain where my anus likely is.   


I needed to get a good look at it to see what I was dealing with. So I went to the bathroom, stripped neked, propped up my leg on the bathroom stool (amazon), and took a few close-up glamour shots of my anus. With the flash on. After looking at it I cleaned up and went about my day.

"This joke is so old that when I first heard it, it was about a guillotine and a splinter","A physicist, a mathematician and an engineer are arrested and are to be executed by the electric chairFirst, they strap the physicist and pull the lever and nothing happens. Thinking its a sign from God, the physicist is set free. 

Then, they strap in the mathematician and pull the lever and again, nothing happens. Thinking its a sign from God, they release the mathematician. 

Finally, they bring in the engineer and strap him in. As they were going to pull the lever, the engineer suddenly exclaimed, ""Wait! The chair is not plugged in!""

Edit: Calm down your tits people, its a joke. Not a jab at anything or anyone, seriously."
"A mechanical engineer, a biochemist, and a theoretical physicist are all stuck on a deserted island with a can of beans. They all discuss how to open the can.

The mechanical engineer says, ""I can build a pendulum using vines and coconuts. With sufficient force, it will knock the top off the can of beans.""

The biochemist says, ""No, no, you'll ruin the can of beans. I have a much better solution. I can take some coconut juice, mix it with sea water and lime juice to create an acid that will eat off the top of the can.""

The theoretical physicist says, ""You guys are both idiots. Both those methods will ruin the can of beans. I have a foolproof way to open the can without destroying the beans.""

The mechanical engineer and biochemist, both a bit insulted, look at each other and then the theoretical physicist. ""Oh yeah, Mr. Smart Guy? What's your brilliant plan?""

""Easy,"" replied the theoretical physicist.

"An accountant, a musician, and an engineer were talking about wives and mistresses. 

The accountant says ""It's better to have a wife. You can really have a strong bond with one woman and have a stable family situation."" 

The musician says ""No man, I can't be tied down to one woman, it's better to have a mistress. You need that passion!""

The engineer says ""It's better to have both. Then when the mistress thinks you're with the wife, and the wife thinks you're with the mistress, you can sneak into the lab and get some work done.""","A physicist, a mathematician and an engineer are arrested and are to be executed by the electric chairFirst, they strap the physicist and pull the lever and nothing happens.
