<START>I read that this tradition exists because in the past women were basically "traded" into a richer family by marriage. They were kept far away from the guy because the poorer family didn't want to risk him not liking her looks and backing out. That's also essentially the origin of why brides wear veils.<STOP><START>‚ÄúCome dress shopping with me sweetie!‚Äù  
‚ÄúSorry, babe, that‚Äôs bad luck.‚Äù<STOP><START>Pretty sure its from back in the day when marriage was a political exchange and the people getting married didn't know eachother <STOP><START>My wife and I mostly funded our own wedding. Her parents were largely unhelpful and mine could only help so much. I went with her to dress shop with a very close friend. I figured if I was paying for the dress I'd like to see it more than once, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The way her face lit up when she found "the dress" and turned to me to make eye contact was worth absolutely every penny and second spent with her that day. <STOP><START>I wouldn't mind watching my wife try on pretty dresses. Am I weird?<STOP><START>It saves every man from the argument of: 

Girl: "How does this one look?" 

Boy: "Fine."

Girl: "Why just fine? I love this. Why don't you like this?"

Boy: "But I said it was fine."

Girl: "You don't love it?!" 

Boy "......." 

This conversation happens more in my household than I would like to admit. <STOP><START>I wish they would have started the tradition of not seeing your children until they were all grown up. <STOP><START>There is absolutely no way a woman came up with that tradition. <STOP><START>The guys that convinced clothing and shoe stores to put rather comfy chairs everywhere weren't all bad either though!<STOP><START>Why y'all marry people you hate doing stuff with? <STOP><START>I remember my first love, I would have spent my whole life dress shopping with her. I‚Äôd give anything just to sit down and wait for her to pick out a new outfit one last time. Once the lymphoma took over, there‚Äôs no way a ring could‚Äôve stayed on her fingers. I miss her so much.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I like shopping with my girlfriend<STOP><START>I would have given anything to be part of picking out my wife‚Äôs dress. I can‚Äôt imagine anything more perfect then getting to see my beautiful wife in every imaginable shade of beauty. All while preparing to commit herself to me.<STOP><START>It's becoming more common for guys to go with their fiance dress shopping because, you know, they don't mind spending time with their significant other on something that's important to them

Edit: dudes, seriously no one is making you do shit but I didn't think y'all would be so fragile <STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>And the brave men who dodged the wedding shower<STOP><START>no way can someone be this clueless. 

no way. I refuse to believe it.

First, you shouldn't be playing the same song every time you bang...

 second, it should never be this song...

it's absurd that this was even thought of, joke or not.<STOP><START>Id be too busy laughing my ass off if this song came on in the moment.<STOP><START>Omg it gets worse the longer you listen. I am CRYING with laughter. Thanks OP.<STOP><START>I listened to that song and literally have tears in my eyes from cracking up. Thank you for making my day, and my sympathies dude for the absolute roasting you are getting and will continue to get in this comments section.

As to why she didn't say anything, I can only assume she was hoping you would get tired of the song eventually or change up your playlist, so that she wouldn't have to tell you herself and make things awkward. Agree that 2 years is a long time.<STOP><START>This must be a GodTier Shitpost lol. 
I admire your gf's commitment and willpower I cannot stop laughing at mere thought of someone fucking to that song and rythm.<STOP><START>As soon as I saw the thumbnail of the album cover, I thought: please God DONT let it be Cbat...<STOP><START>This man's literally fucked his girl to robot dolphin sounds.<STOP><START>This sounds like an inflatable clown toy falling down the stairs.<STOP><START>\> The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but this part made me lose it, this has to be a joke<STOP><START>My guy. My man. My friend. That song sounds like a mouse caught in the talon of an owl slowly dying. At least the intro does. I couldn't make it much further. It's really bad. I'm so sorry<STOP><START>This is the song that plays when the psycho clown at a haunted carnival is stalking you.

It's like straight up serial killer music.<STOP><START>I tried it on my wife for the sake of science and she asked if I'd acquired a head injury. We are 0 for 2 on this one bud.<STOP><START>Without the song playing she can still tell that he‚Äôs thrusting to a specific song‚Äôs tempo ü§£
I‚Äôm dead

Edit: listened to the song in question. OF COURSE she can tell you‚Äôre thrusting to THAT song. It‚Äôs got the most awkward staccato rhythm I‚Äôve ever heard.<STOP><START>Post the whole playlist you coward. I wanna see just how bad it is.<STOP><START>Im sitting on the toilet laughing uncontrollably to the comments in this thread.

If this was a serious post, OP, you should rethink your approach to sexual relations. It's not about the rhythm, it's about communicating with your partner.<STOP><START>What the fuck made you think this is a ‚Äúlove making song‚Äù? This is some shit Plankton would play while fucking his computer wife.<STOP><START>I just outright refuse to believe this<STOP><START>I hard lol'ed at the casual murder in the YouTube comments:

0:00 - 0:18 The glorious disrobing 

0:18 - 0:24 The clumsy foreplay 

0:24 - 2:45 The unorthodox pounding 

2:45 - 2:52 The unsatisfying climax/ The sudden softening<STOP><START>Na man, this has to be some kinda joke, please be a joke, please be a joke. Wtf is that song all about bro üò≠üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇ<STOP><START>üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ bro wtf is this song? when they say ‚Äúlove making music,‚Äù they mean like Marvin Gaye, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get it on,‚Äù I would run if someone put that shit on.

Why don‚Äôt you just try being present with your lady? Pay attention to the sounds SHE makes, not‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ whatever the fuck that was<STOP><START>Okay, now I really want to hear the entire playlist.<STOP><START>I'm sorry but listening to the song and with the context of this story is just hilarious. Trying my best not to crack up in class.<STOP><START>Perhaps, and correct me if I'm wrong, you shouldn't follow the same set pattern, set rhythm, and set song for sex for two years straight. She must be bored as shit.<STOP><START>Different strokes for different folks, but this song turned my dick into an innie.<STOP><START>How on earth did you listen to that song and think "wow what a great song to play during sex" ??? I am wheezing this is absolutely horrendous, props to your gf for not leaving, she‚Äôs a saint for enduring this so long lmaooo

Also, if you need a song to tell you the exact rythmn to use I‚Äôm gonna have to say, you‚Äôre probably doing sex wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt be more focused on the beat of the song than on your partner. It‚Äôs weird that you need music (especially this one lol) to find it and that you can‚Äôt get into the "deed" as you say without playing it in your head. So weird.<STOP><START>I get why she hates it, how the fuck can you perform with that beat and silly noises. You got to be joking right?<STOP><START>I wasn‚Äôt gonna listen to it but then I did and it literally sounds like a dying erection the whole way through, especially at the end. This is pure comedy. I feel like someone heard this song and thought omg this would be the worst song ever to have sex to and then invented this story. Amazing.<STOP><START>![gif](giphy|PDsgxQoXvUZGg)

OP<STOP><START>Lmfao i just heard the song. Holy shit it's eerie and creepy. I'm laughing so hard as i type this. How does one ever come to a conclusion that this is a romantic love making song? 

You're not dancing mate... you're having sex. You don't need 1 2 cha cha cha rhythm to fuck.

Music during sex should be used for ambience and ambience only.

Ps- 
She got tortured for two years and still didn't leave? She's a keeper! You struck gold<STOP><START>You can always try... not doing this? It doesnt make sex better thats where you're going wrong.  Or put on music she prefers for once<STOP><START>She probably imagines that beep booping sound is your penis singing<STOP><START>Woman here, it does sound horrible ü§£ but why you guys never talk about it before? How could she endured *this* for 2 years ü•≤<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>You are supposed to be a little stiff while having sex


Ay yo

Edit: I listened to the song now plz tell me you weren't really fucking her to the beat of this<STOP><START>That song sounds like a toddler with a xylophone and a Casio keyboard, wtf<STOP><START>That's some good Human Music<STOP><START>Oh wow yeah this is absolutely horrible, it got me out of horny jail immediately. Start your sexual relationship completely from scratch and maybe play music she specifically chooses. She could have said something but why would you ever think these were good tunes for sex?<STOP><START>I mean, not every woman is gonna wanna pretend she's getting banged by a seal playing a triangle...

I kinda wanna use this as the basis of the worse sex playlist possible. maybe segue from this into a 8 minute version of popcorn, maybe onto some acid jazz....<STOP><START>I was seriously giving this story the benefit of a doubt until I clicked on that song X\_X<STOP><START>I implore anyone reading this TIFU to check the song out. I haven't simultaneously been so soft and laughed this hard in months.<STOP><START>PLEASE DROP THE ENTIRE PLAYLIST<STOP><START>The song is like kryptonite for a boner...<STOP><START>Why, why, why would you think a song that sounds like it's being played by preschoolers on bicycle horns would be good for sexy times?<STOP><START>If you are this focused on the music and rhythm, you aren't focused on your partner and their pleasure. Just something to consider<STOP><START>After listening to the song, this HAS to be a joke, right? Right?? I am both asexual AND autistic and know that is a SHIT SONG FOR SEX.<STOP><START>I listened to the song. It felt like someone poured sand in my vagina.<STOP><START>Ooo eee ooo oo oo oo eee

Ooo eee ooo oo oo oo eeeeeee<STOP><START>This is maybe the funniest shit I‚Äôve ever read. I imagine if my boyfriend played the workaholics theme song while fucking me I‚Äôd be a little disenchanted too. Just stick to Redbone on repeat it works every time<STOP><START>Dude pavloved his mind into busting to robot dolphins having a rap battle<STOP><START>That song is fucking terrible.<STOP><START>While reading your text I thought of some lame ass joke about which exact weird song you're using, but Sir, the song you actually linked is too hard to top

is that like.. a dolphin..?<STOP><START>Dude trust me:  
If she was willing to listen to THAT song while having sex FOR TWO YEARS without complaining... she is the one. She will not leave you, even if you murder her parents.  


Just get on with it and be happy that she is so loyal!<STOP><START>It's *not* her OP, it's you.

Like omfg that song, no no no what in the holy hell made you think that is a) a good song, let alone b) such a good song that you need to boink to it for 2 years straight? The fact that she endeared that implies to me that she likes you though, so at least there's that.

I'm laughing the hardest I have in my life rn.<STOP><START>Surely you're taking the piss üòÇ I can't sit here and focus on the words on your post with that ridiculous shite playing, let alone imagine fucking my GF to the beat üòÇ<STOP><START>My brother in christ, when the main melody of this song came on I burst out laughing at someone considering this to be a "love making song". I am legit dying laughing right now picturing this shit.<STOP><START>There‚Äôs no way this is real. That song sounds like it was made by a shitty AI that was also somehow drunk.<STOP><START>Holy shit I‚Äôm gone. Please tell me you weren‚Äôt thrusting in time to the beeps and boops. 

I don‚Äôt want to believe<STOP><START>After listening to just small pieces of the song, i can earnestly say i would have rather been rick rolled.<STOP><START>Dude, this is what plays when you're in an evil scientist's lair being pursued by his robot minions. Not sexy at all üíÄüíÄüíÄ<STOP><START>Jesus fuck, are you serious? Is this some sort of low brow, (likely highly successful) marketing attempt to get that shit out there?

That is TERRIBLE MUSIC for ANYTHING.

I imagine you beep bop boop fucking a bucket of sand to that, no way anyone would entertain that crap for 2 years unless the sex was annual, and even then‚Ä¶<STOP><START>Ahahaha. I thought it was going to be Barry White or something, not some freaky alien transmissions.<STOP><START>This has to be a shitpost no way a human male thought that was good fuckin music‚Ä¶just no way<STOP><START>Are you braindead<STOP><START>18yo girl dating a 23yo man who is rhythmically thrusting to the same songs year after year.

This is hilarious but also pretty sad<STOP><START>I had an awkward erection before I listened to that song, thanks for getting rid of it for me!<STOP><START>Yeah bro this song sucks.

My ex had blood type ab. She told me her dad had blood type O+. I told her that didn‚Äôt work. 

Her mom admitted that her dad wasn‚Äôt her dad. 

Fucked my birthday right up. <STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I had the opposite thing happen. I did 23 & Me and found out that my first cousins, who I'm not close with (they were estranged for a long time from my dad's brother), also had done 23 & Me because it matched us as first cousins.

I told my dad this and he was like wait, it said that Karen is your first cousin? And I was like yeah? And he asked to see it and then he said, I have to call my brother.

Turned out that my uncle has been convinced for decades that his ex-wife had an affair and his youngest daughter, Karen, wasn't really his.

Turns out she has been this whole time.<STOP><START>My father also used the AncestryDNA kit. He didn't find anything unusual in the results, exactly what he thought it would be. But something weird did happen after he checked the box to allow "close matches" to contact him.

Well, soon after he gets contacted by a woman he had never met who lives over a thousand miles away from him, saying that Ancestry told her that the two of them are cousins. Genealogical records show no relation, but she told my Dad that of her three siblings, only one of them had the "expected" ancestry report. Their parents were no longer living, so no one to ask.

Anyway, upon further conversation, my Dad finds out that when this woman was born, she lived in the same city as most of my Dad's family. So he asks her to send him a picture, and he swears, "It's uncle Louie in a wig!"<STOP><START>People who were just banging away in the 80s and 90s didn‚Äôt see this one coming. Damn. <STOP><START>I work at AncestryDNA. This actually happens all the time.

Edit: Wow! Didn‚Äôt expect this much attention! I will gladly do an AMA here soon, as I finish out the holidays. Merry Christmas!<STOP><START>This actually just happened to some non-direct relatives of mine, essentially my uncles in-laws. 

His brother in law and the wife have three kids who all did 23AndMe, and found out the oldest girl is not his daughter, but some other guy that his wife slept with early on in their marriage, got pregnant and thought she‚Äôd be able to hide it forever (the daughters like 32 now so they didn‚Äôt have at home DNA tests back then and she probably never foresaw that being a thing). Long story short we kind of always knew because she didn‚Äôt look like anyone else in that family but when they found out they all flipped on their mom about it and now the parents are getting divorced.

Merry fucking Christmas<STOP><START>Shit, now I'm remembering how my mom didn't want me to get a 23 and me kit last Christmas. Her reasoning was that it was a waste of 99 dollars and I could just average the results from her and my father's exams...<STOP><START>* Best case scenario: one of the kids has a different dad
* Worst case: all of the kids have a different dad
* Worster case: all the kids have a *different* different dad.<STOP><START>I love Christmas. <STOP><START>I was at an eclipse party, and met a guy with a VERY interesting 23andMe story.

He was adopted, and had taken the test a couple of years ago.  To his surprise, he had something like 10 half-siblings from his father's side, from all over the country.  After contacting them, he learned that his bio-father was a serial rapist that had never been caught.<STOP><START>‚Äúand we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad‚Äù

I‚Äôm sorry but that made me giggle. <STOP><START>Love the mental image of all the kids in various states of inebriation sitting in a circle playing "guess the bastard". 

"Lookit this guy! Lookit that fuckin' nose! You see the rest of us with that nose?"<STOP><START>Excellent Christmas drama. OP update us on who is your new dad.<STOP><START>We're going to want an update on this story...

&#x200B;<STOP><START>Given your parents reaction, you weren't the one who fucked up here.<STOP><START>True story: my husband's grandfather is NOT my husband's grandfather. Also the mystery of why my mother-in-law doesn't look like her sisters was solved all thanks to these kits. <STOP><START>>She told us how she didn‚Äôt want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals.

This adds so much to the authenticity of the story. This is exactly the kind of thing someone comes up with on the spot to try, and fail, to hide something.<STOP><START>Do divorce lawyers run holiday specials?<STOP><START>I mean, it is OP‚Äôs mom so any of us could be the father.<STOP><START>I think mom may have hid some things. Keep us updated op<STOP><START>I bought one, and my dad wasn't my dad. And my oldest sister was only my half-sister<STOP><START>My sister and I both took tests a while ago. My parents just got their results in last week. My mom sighed BIG TIME when my dad matched with my sister. She cheated on him just before she got pregnant. <STOP><START>Hahaha..  sorry, not funny, but a similar thing happened with me.  My mom bought both of my sisters DNA kits and when I inquired as to why I was left out she told me my results would be the same as theirs, so I asked why she bothered getting them both the kits and she got dead serious and told me I needed to stop.<STOP><START>Once took a DNA test that said I had a higher chance of developing Alzheimer's disease.  Been trying to forget about ever since.<STOP><START>How to break up a family, Part 1. 

Please give us a Part 2

P.S Sorry about that situation <STOP><START>A few years ago someone I know found out that his parents weren't his by doing a DNA test. They wanted to check their ancestry line.  
He was an adult, and was pissed off that his parents never told him he was adopted. The funny thing is, that it was a complete surprise to his parents. They claimed he wasn't adopted, and were sure he was their kid.  
Turned out he was switched at child birth at the hospital, so they raised him as their own, and their biological child was raised by someone else.  
Needless to say, they sued the hell out of the hospital.<STOP><START>Literally every time someone posts a DNA kit in this sub, I know to some degree of accuracy what‚Äôs about to happen. 

It never gets old, though. <STOP><START>Did you have any inkling/clue that someone may have had a different father? <STOP><START>‚ÄúLast Christmas, I gave you a test. The very same day, we found out we don‚Äôt have the same DNA.‚Äù <STOP><START>Wow, that's going to be a Christmas no one shall forget.<STOP><START>I feel like there‚Äôs only two ways these kits can go:

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs interesting, I‚Äôm 5% Italian. Must explain my love for pasta, ha ha ha.‚Äù

Or

‚ÄúDad is not my dad?‚Äù <STOP><START>My dad's now ex-wife's children refuse to take them too... at the insistence of their mother. Guess they aren't his children! <STOP><START>Don‚Äôt feel guilty. It‚Äôs not your fault your mother cheated.<STOP><START>Next Christmas will be better with all the dads there.<STOP><START>Fuck I mentioned these kits to my mum and she did the same thing, "waste of money, they can put anything in there and it doesn't mean it's true" now I'm worried.<STOP><START>I Should have suggested this idea to my fianc√©

There is a suspicion in the family that the second-youngest brother may have a different Dad to the rest, as apparently the mum was sleeping around at the time he was conceived and he doesn't look much like any of the other siblings.

They're planning to do a DNA comparison between him and the half-brother soon to find out for sure. <STOP><START>Hey, your Mom is the one who caused this, not you. Do not let her shift blame to you like it is your fault. She is the one who may have cheated.

Just remember whoever it is, the guy who raised you is still your dad. He might not be your biological father, but he is your dad. Personal bonds and stronger than blood.

Edit: Went to watch Muppets Christmas and when I came back this exploded! Thanks for the first Silver! I don‚Äôt know what it does, but I am very thankful. I always grew up knowing family friends better than blood relatives. I don‚Äôt know half of my aunts names, and they probably care less about me than I do of them. The people you know best matter the most. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a step father, a best friend, your significant other, or anyone else close to you. Those close to you are your real family, regardless of Blood.<STOP><START>So I spent a year and half working as a phone agent with AncestryDNA. I had a number of calls with people upset that we ruined their lives due families not being what Mom said they were. 

Remember that the tests may say who you are biologically related to. They cannot tell you who your family is that has been with you all your life and have loved you. It will without a doubt change things, but only to the extent that you let it.<STOP><START>>we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad

It's an unfortunate situation but I've got this mental image of a group of early 20s siblings sat looking at each other like;

"I think you might be the one with a different dad Mary-Beth."

"Nuh-uh, Jason, it's clearly you."

While De'Sean is sat there, avoiding eye contact.<STOP><START>Will you be updating and sharing your results when/if everyone participates?<STOP><START>> TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Do tests quickly!!! SEND OUT before your mom destroys them!<STOP><START>Commenting for a later update maybe you were stolen at birth<STOP><START>My family did that a couple years ago...I have a half brother! Turns out my golden boy dad got his college gf pregnant. She didn't want a kid because she was going to be a career woman. They put him up for adoption 35 years later 23&me tells me I (27yo) have a 35 yo grandpa. I was joking with my family that grandma was naughty, nope dad was, sorta. Next year they are joining us for Christmas, they joined us for Easter this year. It's been great!<STOP><START>This is even more of a reason to utilize the kit, as your potential father could have a disease history that might alter your futures and possibly extend your lives. Tough shit on your mom, but she gets what she deserves on this. I mean if I had one parent with a family history of something like Huntington‚Äôs I‚Äôd be fucking pissed if I didn‚Äôt know and passed that gene on. <STOP><START>If AncestryDNA had been around when Jesus was born, Christmas might be a very different holiday.<STOP><START>My girlfriend got me a kit last Christmas, and the results were SUPER interesting. I found out I'm 49% Irish (I knew I was around half), 49% English (didn't know that), 0% German (was told I was quite a bit), 2% French (Oui Oui ladies üòò), and that I have an older half sister no one knew about (father's side). Turns out m'dear ol' Dad had some fun in his early years and got a lady pregnant. She never told him and gave the poor thing away for adoption. 

Luckily, she grew up in a very loving family, and get this weird shit...only an hour away from where I grew up. 

Well, we welcomed her and her family (husband and a whole mess of kids) with very open arms. We were all thrilled to have an addition to the fam. 

I can see how these things backfire, but, for us, it was a wonderful surprise! <STOP><START>Twist.  OP is actually his father's sister's kid and that cool foreign white haired chick he's been sleeping with is actually his aunt, but most people are cool with it.<STOP><START>Sadly this is probably the best present your dad could have gotten.<STOP><START>Your mom is in the wrong for keeping that secret from the rest of the family for so long.

You didn't mess up. Your mom did by cheating and lying about it for so long.

Edit: Obviously this was before the latest update. Turns out no one really messed up. Good to hear.<STOP><START>I'm dreading the day my kids want to take one of these stupid ass DNA tests. The only reason they've gotten so popular is because Americans are absolutely obsessed with ethnicity/nationality. 

One of my sons is genetically not mine. His dad is a rapist that is now deseased. His mom a victim. We've hidden this from him for almost a decade now, and now it's painfully obvious that it will all come crashing down. Every time I see one of those commercials I tear up. The Christmas one where the family members have the percentage shared DNA on display is especially brutal. 

He's my son. I'm his father.  I don't ever question it outside of DNA. I love him equally as much as my other child.  I would die for him  He doesn't deserve the heartache that is in store.

<STOP><START>For my next essay for school, I'll dedicate it to his work<STOP><START>I'm kind of amazed that Larry Tesler is the actual name of the person who invented cut, copy, and paste, and he actually did die two days ago. That's way more dedication to research than I've come to expect from /r/jokes.<STOP><START>RIP<STOP><START>RIP Larry Tesler, the UI designer that created Cut, Copy and Paste, died age 74<STOP><START>Damn RIP. Never even thought about the invention of copy and paste.  Such a simple concept but nobody had ever executed before.  Gonna Ctrl+V with gratitude today.<STOP><START>this may be the funniest joke ever posted here. ironic.<STOP><START>There it is.......I knew there was a joke in there somewhere!<STOP><START>You son of a bitch, take my upvote, my downvote and my upvote again.

You win this time.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I don't get it<STOP><START>I sat at my dining room table under a very dim fan light that I could have sworn used to be brighter a year ago reading your post. I got up and hunted down the fan remote stuck forgotten in a drawer and replaced the batteries. There was not obvious slider for a dimmer but I just held the light button down and what do you know the light got a lot brighter! It is fair to say that your post has brightened my life. Thanks<STOP><START>True story, I installed a food disposal years ago and forgot to knock out a plastic piece to hook to the water line. The first time the dishwasher ran after that  it didn't drain. I thought the dishwasher went bad too and didn't replace it for a year and washed dishes by hand. When I bought a new dishwasher and went to hook it up to the water line I discovered my mistake. I never told my wife what the real problem was. LOL<STOP><START>Long term troll, your wife knew about it and was waiting for you to finally try to fix it.<STOP><START>Glad I didn't wait 6 years to figure that one out when we bought a house,  It only took my 5 year old 2 months to tell us what the problem was. <STOP><START>I'm gonna be honest.... I totally thought this would end in you finding a huge spider's web or rat's nest or a mass of cockroaches or something when you changed your light. I'm glad it wasn't. Your result was a lot more wholesome. 
<STOP><START>Something else might have been set to dim too. <STOP><START>OMG u/moby323 thank you.  We moved into a new house several months ago. The ceiling fan light in my office works but wasn't bright enough. I've just been ignoring it.  Your post inspired me to see if it was dimmed.  It was in fact dimmed. Much better now.

&#x200B;

Edit: many people have asked, so I will explain that the remote control has two buttons for the light. I assumed one would brighten and one would dim. But they both toggle. Odd, but I ignored it. Turns out if you hold the button it changes brightness.  From the replies, it seems that standard behavior is a single light button that cycles through brightness.  This one, the button you choose determines the direction it starts in when cycling brightness.

&#x200B;

Also, thank you for the gilding, kind strangers.  Did y'all know that gold comes with a week of Premium? I didn't. That's pretty kickass. Also 100 Coins which is enough to give silver. Nice.<STOP><START>Lmao that title sounded way more ominous than the actual fuck up. I'm glad it's not a darker story<STOP><START>Your night vision ability improved so this isn't a fuck up.<STOP><START>The part I love most is that it's been six years. Like a month would get a slight chuckle, a year would see me expel air from my nose, but six years!? I was 14 six years ago, I was in grade 9 and didn't even have a job. That is how long you have just accepted this misfortune of having no overhead bedroom light only to find out it's dimmable. What was your reaction?

I feel like I wear the scarlet letter and I have been shunned by most of my friends because of my temper I (32M) am honestly desperate to get out of this shitty life, but I just don‚Äôt fully get reddit (specially karmas) I just know it is the only place I can get saved and back to a normal and if possible interesting life.

This has made my day.<STOP><START>That's what high rise housing was like before the elevators were invented.

Hope the cake was good.<STOP><START>Just a heads up, let the neighbor know what happened, and ask them to keep a lookout for Karen.

I literally grew up in a small town in Texas.<STOP><START>Maybe I am a bit paranoid, but I would had followed through with the police and the delivery app all the way to get the person's name and everything. She already have your address and in her mind you stole that dog, I mean, she can try to steal it and you know golden retrievers will go out with just about anyone. Maybe an official complaint with the police might be in order. I'm just paranoid with pets man. Sorry if I give you something else to worry in your already shitty day.<STOP><START>I'm rollin cause as soon as you said she asked if it was your dog, I knew what was up.

**This happened an hour ago, and I‚Äôm still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....

There‚Äôs 2 ‚Äúsituations‚Äù that leads to the conclusion of the FU.

First situation:

Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.

Found out the memory card still had content.

Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 ‚Äúporn‚Äù video, assuming sent to him a while back.

I‚Äôve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.

A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.

So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I‚Äôve always fantasized about, ‚Äúgifting my past self‚Äù, while living my happy current life.

Second accident:

I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.

Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it‚Äôs useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she‚Äôs at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.

Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?

I have the day off today, today was the day I‚Äôd do the ‚Äúdeed‚Äù. I don‚Äôt only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.

This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.

But the ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.

Wife‚Äôs phone didn‚Äôt give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.

She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.

She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.

But VR porn was never ‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù as an ‚Äúis it cheating if....‚Äù thing. You know the convo I‚Äôm talking about, ‚Äúis it cheating if you have a sex doll‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if it‚Äôs a robot‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time‚Äù, etc...

It was the type of convo we‚Äôd have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let‚Äôs say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we‚Äôre on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.

Anyways, VR wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthing‚Äù back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for me to do so. I guess it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That‚Äôs when I see her in the room.

‚ÄúThe fuck??‚Äù she says.

Then she looks inside.

‚ÄúIs that my sister?!?!‚Äù

I‚Äôm fucked.

She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.

Seeing from the tracking app... she‚Äôs at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.

I‚Äôm fucked.

**UPDATE**: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that‚Äôs when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it‚Äôs called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.

I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.

So basically... after posting... after feeling a ‚Äúbit‚Äù better by ‚Äútelling someone‚Äù and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...

This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn‚Äôt focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying ‚ÄúCall me‚Äù.

I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn‚Äôt help as I didn‚Äôt focus once on Detective Pikachu.

I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....

On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me ‚Äúfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it‚Äù

Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....

I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù but there was nothing to be ‚Äúsorry‚Äù about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I‚Äôm not for confrontations or leading conversations, I‚Äôm very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù.... but didn‚Äôt know how.

Wife then says ‚ÄúI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.‚Äù

Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says ‚Äúknows what?‚Äù

She says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie, the video‚Äù.

I was red flushed I‚Äôm sure. My heart was beating so fast.

Then wife said she has deleted the video.

This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....

Then sister-in-law speaks... she says ‚Äúyou do understand this video wasn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.

But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn‚Äôt for her husband neither. He‚Äôs been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he‚Äôs been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it‚Äôs not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.

Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates ‚Äúfor now‚Äù. The divorce word can never go out, but she‚Äôs found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.

It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she‚Äôs been sleeping more and more at her parents house.

Me obtaining the video didn‚Äôt come up more than once. I don‚Äôt know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I‚Äôll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.

For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.

We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.

Wife seemed ok for now too.

TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law‚Äôs 360 porn video, got caught in the act by wife, now feeling out of body experience and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen to my life.<STOP><START>I think you just wanted to flex on us with those airpods<STOP><START>You really go all out for your beat off sessions<STOP><START>>This happened an hour ago, and I‚Äôm still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....

Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.

And the sleeping bags in the living room thing makes this seem more like a teen fantasy now.<STOP><START>She could think that her sister sent it to you intentionally and that you've been hiding an affair lol<STOP><START>Yeah your def screwed. If it was anyone other than her sister you may have been able to come back.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>An actual fuck up and it happened today.

Also the first update was fishy af.<STOP><START>...Dude. Not only did you get caught jerking off to 360 degrees VR porn by your wife, not only did that porn contain someone you both know, not ONLY is it your wife's sister... it was all without your wife sister's knowledge. So now you look like a horny, pervy scumbag as well as a complete creep. You literally couldn't have fucked up more if you tried, congrats OP!<STOP><START>Hey OP your wife is coming!

Edit: Thank you all for the gold and silver!<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>Hope you saved a copy of the video because that's all the sex you gonna get in a long time while the divorce goes on.<STOP><START>This is the single dumbest action I've heard of on Reddit in my very short Reddit scrolling career.<STOP><START>Clearly you did everything in your power to fix this - posting the whole story to Reddit. Hope the divorce goes quickly.<STOP><START>Is no one gonna mention he typed out: "Master bating"<STOP><START>they had us in the first half, not gonna lie<STOP><START>I believed this last night but after all these edits, doubt it‚Äôs true. Who shares a throwaway account anyway lmao<STOP><START>YTA<STOP><START>You only have one way out of this: Make your own 360¬∫ porn video, send to sister-in-law husband and make him masturbate to you, so sister-in-law can get him in the act and divorce him to, so you can marry sister-in-law and her (now ex)husband can marry your wife.<STOP><START>Yeeeeah i don't think this is real<STOP><START>Went too far with the update. Was totally believable before that point :(<STOP><START>Most of these fuck up's are just super embarrassing moments that people eventually get over. But when your fuck up leads to Divorce, you done fucked up for real.

Good Luck OP.  Call a lawyer while you wait.<STOP><START>Just jerk off like a normal person<STOP><START>I 100% see this going to the front page.

EDIT: 100,000 upvotes and on the front page, goddamn this is probably my favorite TIFU I've ever read.<STOP><START>Question, is she charging her phone at her parent's house or is her phone still dead because how would you know she's there if her phone's dead?

&#x200B;

Also, good luck.<STOP><START>Just read your update damn I can‚Äôt believe this story anymore there‚Äôs no way this is real<STOP><START>I‚Äôd like to be able to say things will get better, but there‚Äôs just so much bad in this story.

1. You‚Äôve had a thing for your SIL since before marriage.
2. You imagine what could have been, instead of devoting entirely to your wife.
3. You viewed your SIL‚Äôs video knowing it wasn‚Äôt for you, and you did it deliberately.

Some couples are cool with their partner masturbating to porn, it sounds like you were fairly aware your wife would have been unhappy and yet you knowingly went and did it anyway. And it wasn‚Äôt just any old porn, but her sister. I don‚Äôt care about your FU right now, I‚Äôd be more worried about your wife and how she must feel.

It IS possible to come back from this, but you better be prepared to work for it, and understand your wife and family may be very upset for a long while. Assuming your marriage is worth saving. I and everyone else here doesn‚Äôt know what kind of marriage you have, but you haven‚Äôt exactly painted the best picture.

Also, tracking app sounds super weird.

Edit: when I say it‚Äôs possible to come back, this is all provided the wife gives OP a second chance. It‚Äôs always possible, I highly doubt it after this, but possible. 

I am open with my husband doing plenty but I think if I caught him jerking off to my sister I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take it.<STOP><START>A pervert and divorced.

Now thats a tifu

Edit - oh hey, I got a silver. I feel so special for pointing out OP's fate. To none believers, this sounded really plausible and yall men should know, dick brain can make you do very very dumb stuff.

Edit 2 - hahaha OP did got divorced. Sorry for the ex wife and her family. But OP really dug up his grave and awarded the biggest fucked up of 2019<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I no longer believe this is real after the update.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>If you want to win ALL of the internet points ever and derail any possibility of a better TIFU:

Show your wife this post (as it explains your situation in its entirety) and record the fallout in 360 degree VR.

We need this.<STOP><START>Wow. I don‚Äôt think I can comfort you, this isn‚Äôt likely to end well. But maybe you‚Äôll find some level of satisfaction knowing that this might end up as Reddit TIFU legend?<STOP><START>Not sure how you can honestly say you weren‚Äôt sure if it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù/cheating<STOP><START>This all "what is cheating" is...next level weird. I mean, wtf.<STOP><START>I was ready to believe this until the wife mentioned that he tried to come on to her sister last night. That shattered the illusion. There is no way a person could be that stupid and survive childhood. True or not it was very entertaining.<STOP><START>Rule 1) Never get into a land war in Asia
Rule 2) Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line 

And 

Rule 3) Never go ‚Äúfully immersive‚Äù unless you are 1000% confident no one is going to catch you.<STOP><START>This is a better story arch than season 8 of GOT.<STOP><START>You not only spent the majority of this post talking about how much of a sexual fixation you have for your wife's sister, but then deliberately planned a wank sesh to a video (that you did not have permission to view) of your SIL while your wife was out of the house.

The blatant disrespect you have for your wife and your relationship is outstanding.

Also, stop watching explicit videos of people who did not give you permission to watch. Think of how utterly gross and violated the SIL would feel having her sister's husband jerk off to a video she made for her OWN HUSBAND.<STOP><START>I believed this before he posted the update, but reading the update makes the whole thing look like a fiction novel. Seems very very very weird family dynamics. Not really believable. Shouldn‚Äôt have posted the update OP.<STOP><START>Not only did you perv on your wife's sister, you used a private video she made for her husband, that she definitely didn't want you to see, to do it. Really, truly disgusting.<STOP><START>It wasn't the vr, man. You don't need to have the 'what constitutes as cheating' discussion to know that masturbating to your wife's sister is wrong. Now when she sees her sister she has to think about the fact you want to stick it in her. You're supposed to be family, man. You can't act on base instincts like that with family.

Also, it sounds like you need to figure your shit out. You add in backstory about this thing you had with your wife's sister like it pardons you for jerking it to her because it's just 'fantasy' and not 'actually sleeping with the woman I still seem to be crushing on'. No man, that makes it worse. You need to let this fantasy of the two of you together go COMPLETELY, and treat her like your biological sister, if you want any chance of staying with your wife. 

TLDR; stop perving on your wife's sister. It's a complete violation of trust. The past is the past.

Edit: I misread the part where she was mad THEN looked and saw her sister. I assumed she knew it was her sister when she ripped off the headset. (Maybe vr headset hooked up to the computer as is sometimes done).

 I still think vr porn is something you can talk about pretty reasonably. Vr porn with you sister in law.... not so much. It was definitely the meat of the problem.

Edit2: My first gold, omigod. Thank you kind stranger :o<STOP><START>>she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?

Can we stop with this assumption? In general? We survived hundreds of years without being able to be contacted every second of the day. 

Am I alone in thinking the perpetual tracking that's mentioned in this post is creepy?<STOP><START>Am I the only one here that thinks this is a great story but never actually happened?<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>You're fucked. Sorry mate. You deserve it.<STOP><START>Because you just HAD to jack it to your wife's sister, right? Good god, you are dead lol.<STOP><START>An hour ago? And one of your first thoughts is to carefully write it all out for Reddit?<STOP><START>I did not see that update coming. Twist of the fucking century!<STOP><START>lads... the man said he made a throwaway for the post, but the wife said she can edit this because they share a reddit account... we may have been karma-heisted<STOP><START>Anyone else think this sounds like total BS?<STOP><START>Imagine being this devoted to your story...<STOP><START>Literally 7 billion other people you could have wanked it to but you decided to make it a close acquaintance. Your wife will never see you as the same person, and trust is gone. Prepare yourself for a divorce. Sorry buddy, this is what thinking with your dick gets you...<STOP><START>What is wrong with you? Jesus Christ.<STOP><START>‚ÄúI use your sister to wank over because I know I won‚Äôt blow my beans. It‚Äôs my way of building up a heavy load of man love especially for you because I love you so much.‚Äù<STOP><START>Sounds made up, or stolen from someone else's bit.<STOP><START>She gonna divorce you for sureeeee. In the dog house with you!<STOP><START>I don‚Äôt have any sympathy. Sorry. I mean I hope it works out for you and all, but I have no sympathy.

Wish I had someone to give the greens to (I hoard the red and yellows).<STOP><START>My husband and I have been together for almost 8 years now. Up until last year, we had shared Oreos a certain way. I don't like the middle but I like the cookie. He said he liked doubles, so we would always twist our cookies apart and swap a piece. Win-win, it was a whole thing, and it turns out he has been making himself eat double stuffed Oreos for years because he ALSO only likes the cookie but he didn't want to deprive me. You did, like, the opposite and it's adorably hilarious. Y'all will be laughing about this not too far down the road.<STOP><START>The wife here. We even got some Christmas ones that were all green and red for our kids‚Äô stockings and I said, ‚ÄúHey! They didn‚Äôt make the green ones lime in these!

Seven years later, my husband was looking for something sweet. He remarked that he wished he could have some of his grandmother's chocolate cake. So naturally I said, "I have the recipe, I can make it for you." The look of utter betrayal on his face was astounding. He *could not* believe that in seven years of marriage I never once made it, or even let him know I had the recipe. My response was, you never asked. He was wounded a second time, right to the heart. 

That was a decade ago and I haven't lived it down yet.<STOP><START>Be wary if she ever DOES start giving you gummy bears again.

There‚Äôs a sugar free version, and you need only look at the Amazon reviews to understand that she isn‚Äôt giving you those gummy bears because she forgave you.<STOP><START>There is no coming back from this.

"Fine, we'll make the car drive itself."<STOP><START>Ok listen to this crazy fucking ‚Äúwe are living in the future‚Äù shit. 


I‚Äôm Brazilian but grew up in the US. 

My family in Brazil are farmers/ranchers that live IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, literally they didn‚Äôt have grid electricity until 2015, their closest neighbor is over 10km away and the closest town is a half-day drive. 


My mom was visiting last year, and they were in the nearest town (a town that you can ONLY reach by boat or plane from the larger outside world.)

While they were walking and shopping in town, a purse snatcher hit my mom and took her purse which had her wallet, passport, and phone. 

My sister calls me, tells me about it. 

Turns out the criminals were stupid enough to try to use the phone multiple times, so ‚Äúfind my iphone‚Äù located them. 


So I tell my mom ‚ÄúTell the police it is on such and such street near the intersection of such and such. ‚Äú


So my mom goes there with the cops, but it‚Äôs basically a shanty town. Mom calls and says ‚ÄúThere are lots of houses here, we don‚Äôt know which one. ‚Äú

Then literally fucking google street view was active, in this MIDDLE OF NOWHERE TOWN. Blew my fucking mind. 

So i looked around in street view  and called her and said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the house with a yellow gate.‚Äù


Cops knocked on the door, went in, recovered her wallet, passport, and phone. 

I‚Äôm fucking a thousand miles away and in real-time found the specific location of criminals in some obscure, rural fucking town in the middle of nowhere in the Amazon. 

By using Google. <STOP><START>"What about places that don't have roads?"

"I don't know, stick a camera on someone's back and have them walk it." <STOP><START>I wonder how many people they have doing that, and how much they get paid to do it<STOP><START>The dudes at google also backed up the whole internet as a project in college. 

Their teacher thought it was an impossible task. <STOP><START>Imagine if it was just one guy that did all the driving. That would make a pretty fun documentary actually. It would need some sort of catchy title though.<STOP><START>They also do it more than once.<STOP><START>They even sent some poor guy to do it on the moon.<STOP><START>Eh, there's a number of roads in Detroit that google didn't get.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I can imagine that meeting.


> **Rahul :** "So i  woke up in the middle of the night with this idea. Imagine if you could click anywhere on Google Maps and actually see the roads. So it's as if you are walking down the street. And it could be 3D images so you can look around. Pretty cool huh!"

> **Mary:** "Haha. Good one Rahul."


> **Rahul:** "No, I'm serious. We should do it."


> **Mary :** "Rahul, you do realize that would require driving on every road in the world with a camera!"


> **Rahul :** "Yes. Obviously. And your point is....?"


I like Rahul. People should be more like Rahul.

The shady phone fixing booth in my local mall invested heavily in them, and complained to mall management trying to get them to ban other stores in the mall from selling them, because they felt like it was *their* idea. It's funny, because they still have tons of them that they never sold.

Fucking rock on, Reddit you weird, beautiful site you. So far I think it's 50+ gold, case anyone was wondering.<STOP><START>Fidget spinners are going to be remembered as the Tickle Me Elmo or Tamagotchi pets of a new generation.<STOP><START>True in a way: they were originally designed as an aid for those who need something to do with their hands to help them concentrate.  Many people assumed that this meant *anyone* with problems focusing on things (eg. Those with ADHD, etc), and then their friends all had to have one too because they were neat.  *This* is what lead to the less specific target audience.  When you consider that new target audience, then what you say is absolutely true: those who buy a novelty item simply because it's popular are going to forget about it quickly, because it doesn't actually help them.

The rest of us who *DO* find spinners to be a useful aid in focusing are still using them.  In fact, I just ordered a new one last week because I've now wore out two of them.<STOP><START>I guess this is that 1% non-recycled part of this place.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>Just FYI: If your ctrl key is actually broken (no, not you OP.

What my instructor taught me was simple, "If you have something that makes your life easier or more comfortable, like using kneepads, or grabbing an umbrella, or whatever, and you choose not to use it, you are no tougher or better than the man who chooses to. In fact, if it says anything about you, it probably says you're stupider, because while you're standing there, wet and cold in the rain, he grabbed an umbrella and is dry."

The other is, "The toughest, most "alpha" thing you can do in any situation is the thing you want, while everyone else is catering to others whims, you are confidently being you with no fucks given what others think."<STOP><START>We really need a picture of these awesome shawls!

\*edit\* yay! He added a picture! Great shawls, too. I have.. shawl envy..?<STOP><START>"Give your balls a tug you titfucker"

\-Shawlsy<STOP><START>So, where is the reddit tax of you two tough SHAWLBROS in your shawls. 

I personally favour a nice neutral neutral coloured thin poncho however ponchobro doesn't roll off the tongue as well.

Edit: VINDICATION!!!!  Shawl tax achieved I shall sink into the shadows.<STOP><START>'Today my girlfriend fucked up' by giving a ~~shot~~ shit about a shawl'


FTFY<STOP><START>Shawls before dolls<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>I guess you could say both of those girlfriends were pretty shawllow... I'll see myself out<STOP><START>Where's the tifu? I see this as an absolute win. Got a cool shawl, dropped a dummy.<STOP><START>Sorry to hear man.  But those are girls you don't wanna be with, they liked the image of you in their heads more than the you in reality.

Also, dude good on ya being comfortable in your own skin, and also being self aware enough to know how you deviate from cultural norms, but still being okay with that.<STOP><START>Sounds like she wanted a reason to F off. I say wear what makes you happy. 

There's a great Eddie Izzard - who is an executive transvestite - bit where he says he doesn't wear women's clothes. He wears his clothes. And he rocks it.

So keep on rocking it. Keep being yourself and doing what you want.<STOP><START>And seriously, have these girls never seem Israeli/Middle Eastern military?  Bassass shawls abound.<STOP><START>Is this TIFU or r/dodgedabullet ?<STOP><START>These women need to get bent. If anything to me it solidifies your identity bc you are wearing something that you are comfortable in and fuck all the haters. You do you my man. If my husband all of a sudden decided to wear one of my shawls more power to him. Unless of course I was planning on wearing it that day, in which case we would have to battle over it. A woman who is that concerned about you being a ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù clearly has far deeper insecurities than she is letting on. Good riddance, find yourself a lady who won‚Äôt question you‚Äôre sexuality based on arbitrary reasons.

**Thank you for the silver! I think this is the first time I‚Äôve ever gotten anything like that, I can‚Äôt wait to tell my hubs!

****Holy Macaroni! Thank you for the gold and platinum!!! This is the best day ever, my hubs will be proud and we may just have to go out and buy ourselves some matching shawls in celebration!<STOP><START>The shawl is a blessing in disguise because it exposed your girlfriend's questionable beliefs about masculinity!

I think that by you wearing a shawl and being affectionate with your guy friends it just shows you are comfortable in your masculinity. My partner has the same qualities and I'm marrying him in two weeks!

Get a new girlfriend!<STOP><START>Doesn't sound like a fuckup to me. It sounds like a bullet dodged.

This girl wasn't in love with you, she was in love with an idea that you happened to have fit well enough until she saw the shawl, at which point you no longer fit that idea.

She basically fetishized you and didn't see you as a human being with a rich internal life. Instead she saw you as a G.I. Joe life-sized action figure.

Go enjoy your shawls. Shawls are awesome. Heck, take it a step further and learn how to knit your own, so you can be swaddled in the warmest, most beautiful merino/silk blend ever.<STOP><START>- Likes macho men.
- Shawl looks like Client Eastwood westerns.

Her logic makes perfect sense...<STOP><START>It‚Äôs 2019 and people still assume people‚Äôs sexual preference based on clothes. Neat!

More like blessed shawls that make people show their true selves.<STOP><START>I'm of Indian decent, Punjab specifically. I wear shawls in the winter all the time... In fact, I own my Grandfather's shawl that he also wore everywhere. I've been told multiple times, by multiple women, that they like this fact. I'm on the West coast.. sounds like you're on the east of the US? Is there such a big difference in cultures across the country? I'll have to keep that in mind if I ever move to the east I guess (doubtful though!)<STOP><START>So where can we get these shawls?

Tbh I don't even pay attention to peoples names, and when I do it's usually something like u/TEAR_MY_ASSHOLE_DADDY posting on r/aww so I figured most of reddit didn't care.<STOP><START>In high school, I put some cool red shoe laces in my black military boots.   I wasn‚Äôt a skinhead, I was a punk.   But after I did that, lots of the racist folks around started wanting to hang out.  

Apparently red bootlaces in black boots was a Nazi symbol thing.   

I put the black laces right back in.   Lesson learned.<STOP><START>I‚Äôm living in Colorado and we have 50+ mountains over 14K feet in elevation. They are commonly referred to as fourteeners or 14ers. I was commenting on a sub about online dating and how every guy out here has something about 14ers in their profile and someone thought I was referring to white supremacy. I had no clue at all about the correlation of 14 and white supremacy.<STOP><START>Thank god the nazis didn't pick a more frequently used number.  Like 3.  I don't think I could get on with life if I couldn't use the number three.

"Uh.  Two and one"

"What?  You mean three?"

"For the love of God keep your voice down!"<STOP><START>I would also suggest that you don't put so much personal information on the internet. Telling people that you only use one username and writing about your exact birth date is identifying information that does not need to be online imo.<STOP><START>I too was born in 1988 and have countless usernames with 88 at the end, and just found out about the nazi connotations. Fucking nazis ruining everything.<STOP><START>This is both hilarious and awfully sad. It's too bad you were born Jan 4, 1988.  It's not a good idea to include identifying information like that in a username though.

I was raised on a farm in the Texas Panhandle so when my buddies wanted me to come to a lan party and play some games they did not expect a "redneck" to be an avid gamer and I was given the name by them. I have been waiting for someone to be offended by it. I hope it doesn't offend.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>There is a lot of disinformation going around in these comments about what "1488" actually means.  Some of it is intentional disinformation.  

The 14 words and 88 precepts were a manifesto written by a man named David Lane in 1995.  David Lane was serving his 190 year prison sentence for having a Jewish talk radio host murdered in 1986.  1488 is NOT a 4chan troll, made up, or meaningless, it has a very real and very evil meaning and signifies the codified values of the more violent style of white nationalist alive today.  These are the guys who think the KKK is run by the Jews. You know, morons. 

Now, the 88 precepts, the rules all of these white nationalists are required to live by, are low key ridiculous.  Like Precept 36 straight up bans pornography, if you ever see a white nationalist with a hentai profile picture or something along those lines, ask him about rule 36 and he will lose his fucking mind. 

This has been a PSA: White nationalists are mad all the time because they can't jack it, true story.<STOP><START>I've never heard of this before and I've been on the internet since it was mostly text based.<STOP><START>Not enough that Hitler ruined the Chaplin Mustache, now we let Nazis ruin fuckin NUMBERS?

Disclaimer: As a German, I'm well aware of numbers and Nazis. Still I find it odd that we let THEM dictate what WE can use as a username, not the other way around. Next thing you know, they begin ruining haircuts and brands of clothing for us.<STOP><START>If it makes you feel better - I'm jewish, I'm the granddaughter of 4 holocaust survivors, I am heavily involved in the jewish community and in the holocaust survivor community, I speak about the holocaust publicly and never pass up a chance to call out anti semitism.  And I had to read your whole post to figure out why 1488 is offensive.

Tl/dr the people you may be most concerned about offending are more than likely clueless about 1488.<STOP><START>One might say that you did Nazi that coming.<STOP><START>You‚Äôre sorry? For what!? You did absolutely nothing wrong.<STOP><START>Or let‚Äôs not give nazis random numbers as their own? I mean c‚Äômon people lots of cool shit happened in 1488.<STOP><START>"Spiders?

He popped back one night for a chat & a catch-up. He said that at one point he‚Äôd got a new girlfriend who was a screamer- she shouted & threw herself about & was ridiculously vocal in bed. 

He reckons he‚Äôd had sex with her about 3 or 4 times & whenever he was banging her he was the king of the world. 

...Until half way through their next performance when she stopped all the histrionics and said something along the lines of, ‚Äú I fucking love shagging you- my last boyfriend‚Äôs cock was too big & it used to hurt me. But yours, yours fits just fine.‚Äù

And that was the last time they had sex. 

And then he told all his mates thinking they would sympathise. Oh how they laughed.<STOP><START>The only solution is to seek out this ex boyfriend and have sex with him yourself. You‚Äôll show that girl who means business.<STOP><START>I knew this guy who had a huge donkey dong. Like seriously big, he had won competitions (he was in the army and they did that kind of thing). Well one night he got drunk and he confided to me that it was "a f***ing curse". He told me how women he was about to be intimate with would see it and immediately call it off. Or how he wasnt able to have sex that was pleasurable for girlfriends he was in love with, and that roadblock to normal intimacy ruined the relationship. This big, tough, hung like a gas-pump, soldier was in tears telling me this.

SFW<STOP><START>#Danny Devito and his MAGNUM DONG<STOP><START>I think your feelings are very valid. It's not just about the dick size. Often times, when you find out that your current SO's ex had better income, better job, bigger dick, bigger boobs, or more, you are bound to compare yourself with him/her.

If you truly love your girlfriend and wish to continue the relationship, just sit down with her and be honest. Tell her that you accidentally stumbled upon previous photos with her ex. Don't mention anything about the dick size. Just ask her why she kept those photos. And if she says anything along the line of - I forgot to delete them and all she cares about is you, then you should feel confident that she loves you as a person and everything about you. Of course, you will still have a bit of doubt in yourself that you will never be as good as her ex, but there is a reason why she broke up with her ex, right?  


Edit : Words<STOP><START>Bi guy here. You prob won't read this as it's too far down, but I think my perspective might give you some comfort: from my experience, guys with big dicks usually have trouble staying in long term relationships. While it's an exciting thing to look at in porn, it's nearly impossible to have sex with a large penis. Oral sex, as you describe it, is impossible. Vaginal sex will hurt immensely, and don't even talk about anal sex. I'm also above average and most men won't even consider anal sex, some women have complained about pain after vaginal sex. And I can understand why. I dated a man who had a 10 inch dick, also very thick, but I didn't find out until 2 months into the relationship. Three months later I had to break the relationship because we could not have any sex. He wasn't a bottom and I couldn't bottom for him. Our only sex was jerking off. I hurt him immensely by breaking up the relationship, and I myself was hurt. I felt like shit finding out all his relationships ended because of his dick size. He must go through every beginning of a relationship thinking that it may end sooner rather than later because people get tired of how difficult it is to simply enjoy sex. Think about it? You got the girl.<STOP><START>This actually gave me second hand heartbreak dude.... Like...im so sorry man<STOP><START>Have you tried bringing up you accidentally saw the pictures, how they made you feel, and talked through it? Your head is an echo chamber so you really aren't going to get beyond this on your own. I'm sure she'd even be willing to delete the photos if you asked. There's a chance she doesn't even remember the photos are there - I can't even remember the last time I looked at the older photos in my gallery from 6 months ago, much less over a year ago.

My gf is a total babe and guys hit on her at bars all the time. I just had to find a way to deal with it. The best thing was that I go home with her *every night*.

I have a fair amount of vr games but Google Earth vr is probably one of the most impressive things to show others. 

They have this algorithm that creates 3d structures from satellite photos.  It's not perfect and when you get close you can see the errors, but from a couple hundred feet above it looks amazing.   Feels like you are superman flying around.

I used it to scope out places in Greece ahead of a trip there last fall.  Before I even got there I had a really good sense of the geography, it was almost like I'd been there before. <STOP><START>On my Oculus it's like being a god.

It's also a great way of coping for people who can't travel. Indeed, I've discovered its potential only recently. Suddenly I wanted to eat a typical Jewish dessert, so I thought to look at Venice's ghetto using Google (I study in Venice). I didn't know that they had recreated the whole city in 3D, and there were even a lot of spherical photos of the interiors! Then, I've discovered that there was also a complete tour of the interior of Tolstoj's house. He's a very important writer for me, and without Google Earth I would have never seen it; and it has been fantastic, it really was like being there, but without time limits and with a powerful zoom that allowed me to read some of the titles in his library. <STOP><START>Well it depicts the earth in three dimensions and the smart ones of us all know that it is actually flat so google earth is really just a useless program promoted by OUR GOVERNMENT to make us believe what they want. I bet all you sheeple also believe that contrails are just ‚Äúnormal effects‚Äù of airplane engines. Wake UP!

I once ate half of a lemon drop while visiting my wife's uncle in CO. I'm just glad I didn't eat the whole damn thing. He liked to talk, so fortunately it wasn't too odd for me to just stare and nod. 

But hey, now you know. When it says half a cookie, it means half a cookie. <STOP><START>Reading stories of people fucked up more than they can handle is my favourite.<STOP><START>One night I was the guy at the table who was way too high. Only problem was I was the waiter. I had eaten brownies right before my shift and got WAY higher than anticipated. I was so stoned that I couldn't talk loud enough for my tables to hear me. They seemed irritated. Every time I looked in the mirror my eyes were a darker shade of red. I was overwhelmed with paranoia and certain I was going to get fired and i just kept getting higher. Rough night.<STOP><START>>And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.

That¬¥s when I knew this story was going to be great. Hope your ride went well after dinner. 
Great read btw :)<STOP><START>This is my favorite tifu ever. Thank you, ridiculous man.<STOP><START>I know a girl in California who sometimes sends me edibles. Years ago, she sent me this giant rice krispie treat with a total dosage of 80mg of THC. I decided to eat half and see what happens. Almost nothing. I didn't feel a damn thing. It actually wasn't quite half, probably more like 45%. So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can't get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don't work very well on me. But I didn't know this then.

She sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I'd get a decent high.

Oh my, was that a mistake.

As it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I'd just eaten 220mg. I remember saying at one point, "I can actually feel myself getting higher every second. It's like I'm riding a weed elevator." After about an two hours, I'm losing my shit and then I realize something. My kitchen is messy and the police are definitely on their way to arrest me for letting my kitchen get so messy. So I started freaking out and panic cleaning my kitchen. It's also 2am. So, imagine an insanely high person desperately cleaning his kitchen at 2am, positive the cops are about to break his door down any second and arrest him.

I eventually realize I have to work the next day and I really need to sleep. My shift started at 9am and it's already 2am. I slept for like 5-6 hours and actually woke up feeling completely fine. I don't remember the day at work at all, so I assume it was uneventful.<STOP><START>The whole time becoming unteathered bit is spot on.  Last batch of cookies I made I overshot the strength, and holy shit that was a strange evening.  Great story man, but you really should have seen that coming.  They don't F*** around with edibles in the legal states<STOP><START>I feel your pain man. I once ate 5 edibles before going through security at the airport and had a panic attack on the line to board the plane. Had to leave the line and lay down on the floor because I thought I was dying. Made it to Miami though! <STOP><START>Wow. This is the best written story I've ever read on here. I was laughing all the way through it. Well done OP, hope your wife's parents are cool about it. <STOP><START>>"Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy," I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is nothing on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.

Nope, nope, no. This is the moment I fucking lost it.

I wish I could gild you but I'm broke. This story is glorious from start to finish, hope you're okay now and the parents...tolerate you? <STOP><START>This is so funny, man. My favorite parth was : "'Keep it together, man,' I say to myself. But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter." Classic.<STOP><START>Brilliant stuff, definitely a solid fuck up. Well done, sir! This reminds me of the time I took 5 1/2 tabs of what turned out to be REALLY strong acid. For whatever reason, sometimes acid takes up to 2 hours to kick in, and I was used to about 45 minutes, so when it didn't happen that soon I took a couple more, then more again. 1 tab, 2 tabs, 3 tabs, 4, 5 1/2 tabs...fuck, where's the floor?!<STOP><START>>"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"

Hehe, I had to look this one up, thanks for teaching me something. Your story was great, too. Good writing.<STOP><START>Take a dose. A real dose as is described on the package. Maybe a half dose if you are a neophyte. Wait AT LEAST an hour before taking any more.  <STOP><START>I couldn‚Äôt stifle my laughter and just woke up my very pregnant, poorly and now very angry woman. Very good and funny read, very well written also. May you continue with a follow up of how things went from there? I really gotta know how this panned out in the end as I‚Äôm sure the rest of us do (especially about how your wife was with you in the end) 10/10!! <STOP><START>I feel like this story is unfinished. <STOP><START>upvote for using "Torquemada" <STOP><START>Sooooo....did you eat the rest of the cookies when you got back to the hotel?<STOP><START>This is the best TIFU I have read! I can relate so much, we've all been there. Your storytelling really sets the scene.
The bit where you said the food was too spicy when you've just ordered made me laugh, but then when the waiter suggested eating the bread rolls if they "weren't too spicy for you" had me in stitches!

Edit: omfg first silver! Thank you kind stranger!!<STOP><START>Edit 2: This is the best day of my life. Better than the day I had my kid and got promoted to CEO and won the lottery<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn‚Äôt have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn‚Äôt beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn‚Äôt know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun‚Äô a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn‚Äôt doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I‚Äôve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger!<STOP><START>Have you considered joining l√©gion √©trang√®re?

The boyfriend of my female cousin fucked the girlfriend of my male cousin and the two cousins fucked.

That is single-handedly the most fucked thing I've heard someone do to someone they love, no contest. I don't blame her for electing to leave because of it - not only did you cheat on her, you cheated on her *with your own family,* with her in the other room no less.

Plus you have 45k upvotes now, so you rock OP!<STOP><START>Ah yes, I remember when I saw this on Twitter<STOP><START>Been binge drinking for over a year, never touched alcohol before then, I loved myself sober but everyone hated me, now I hate myself drunk and everyone loves me. 

Edit: 10 days sober<STOP><START>I am very overweight and am trying to lose it. The amount of people who tell me I don‚Äôt need to lose weight because I‚Äôm beautiful how I am is astonishing. 

I tell them that if they think I‚Äôm beautiful now wait til the see the weapon I‚Äôm going to become!<STOP><START>Not to be like an ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äù about it or anything, but as an extremely obese person, I can tell you personally, there are absolutely no positives to living this way.  I don‚Äôt want to be this way, because it hurts, it‚Äôs dangerous, and I know I‚Äôm going to end up dying because of it.  Any other very fat person who tells you otherwise are lying to you and themselves, and they probably know it.  This is a sickness.  I wish every day I weren‚Äôt this way, and I try to motivate myself every day to fix it, but it‚Äôs a sincere mental illness that does not want to fix itself.  I know these problems of mine are made, brick by brick, by myself, but I hate it, and that only leads to me quite literally feeding into it.  People,  don‚Äôt let your kids become fat.  <STOP><START>Do obese people in America not know they need to lose weight? Sounds a lot like telling a smoker that cigarettes cause cancer.<STOP><START>Fun Bobby! <STOP><START>Telling people is easy, but in encouraging them is different.<STOP><START>I feel it should be: Try to consistently better yourself by losing weight. But don't think you have no self worth because you are fat. These two mindsets don't have to be exclusive. <STOP><START>I agree as a dangerously overweight person. However I am losing weight. So telling me to ‚Äújust lose weight or that I have to diet‚Äù it‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyeah, no shit. I am. ‚Äú it takes time. You didn‚Äôt see me 40 pounds ago. So unless you see me wearing powdered donuts like rings or something don‚Äôt assume that person isn‚Äôt trying. Or hasn‚Äôt made progress. And I‚Äôm not saying you are, OP. Not at all. Just to everyone. Learn about the person before expressing concern. <STOP><START>My highest weight was 358lbs at 5'3" tall. I was almost literally as wide as I was tall. I'm down 118lbs thanks to weight loss surgery (wls), diet and exercise. I did it because I knew I was committing a slow suicide through eating. People judge me because I chose wls as a means of saving my life. They don't realize I count every carb, calorie, fat and protein that goes in my mouth. I go to the gym daily and I eat bariatric keto. One of the biggest obstacles I've faced in the process is the judgement you receive when you start your weight loss journey. Everyone has strong opinions on what you should be doing. Instead of saying keep up the good work, they prefer to tell you how they could do it better. It is extremely discouraging. Also, most people in the US haven't been taught how to eat properly, even doctors do fly by nutritional training in their education. We've been taught to eat high carb and low fat. When really that is a terrible diet. Eat processed grains rather than natural foods. Our understanding of nutrition is broken and our people are fat because of it. <STOP><START>It drives me crazy. I recently started keto (about 1 month) and before that people watched me eat entire pizzas regularly on my own and fast food multiple times a day. They would watch me down a double burger with egg, ham, bacon, cheese, 2 glasses of soda and a basket of fries. Yet now I'm losing weight and people come out of the wood work to tell me how unhealthy my diet is. This wouldn't be a big deal except no one ever showed any concern for me eating myself to death before and suddenly now that I've named my meal plan they are happy to critique it rather than show support.<STOP><START>People don't say to not lose weight, they say to not hate yourself. 

if overweight you should try to lose weight, but not hate yourself in the process. Simple as that<STOP><START>You shouldn't make fun of a person for being fat, just like you don't make fun of a person for being sick. But in both cases you encourage them to get better<STOP><START>I think it just means that you don't have to hate yourself just because you are overweight. People that are overweight know they are overweight. 

I'm overweight. Telling me I'm fat isn't what's going to get me to lose weight. Telling me not to lose weight is just trying to make me feel better (like telling someone they look great when they don't). 

As a fatass, we know. <STOP><START>Obesity rarely comes out of nowhere, and the morbidly obese usually have a whole heap of other problems that are less visible, but prevent them from solving the most pressing and visible problem they have.

The idea behind these "fat acceptance" movements are more about trying to adress the other problems these people have (low self-esteem, depression ect.) in hopes that they can adress the unhealthy obesity on their own once their other issues are resolved.
<STOP><START>As an overweight person, I can't stand fat shaming OR encouraging others to be chubby.

Acceptance is cool when others understand that ny weight and shape is my own problem

But jfc if someone is overweight and wants to lose weight please don't tell them otherwise 
<STOP><START>I'm of the mindset that it's not my business. That's between them and their doctor. I'll be nice to them, and compliment them like I would anyone else. There's nothing else to it.<STOP><START>America has a fat acceptance movement now. Which in my opinion is bad because it's setting a standard for being overweight is ok and you are fine how you are. I have nothing against overweight people, but when you try to tell people that it's healthy and you spread that kind of message. Then I have a problem with it.<STOP><START>Health at every size is a lie. Being fat isn't hot nor trendy. <STOP><START>The overweight drunk is still beautifully fun. <STOP><START>Dad...? Is that you??

Jokes aside my parents also hid my gameboy color all the time because I would secretly play under my bed covers when I should be sleeping. They kept hiding it but I kept finding it. I don‚Äôt remember how old I was but i was probably around 10-12. I‚Äôm 30 now and to this day I honestly don‚Äôt remember what happened to it, and my parents also don‚Äôt remember what happened to it. My theory was that it was hid really well for a long duration and eventually everyone just forgot, maybe went on vacation or something. I really do miss it though it was my childhood.<STOP><START>I can't believe the GBA is 18+ years old.<STOP><START>I bet he did all his homework in those 18 years.<STOP><START>Is it just me

Or does the gameboy exist in a different echelon to other toys/entertainment devices


I see stories like this from time to time where a gameboy is lost to the ether for decades

Gets found

Still works

And everything about life is better?

I never see a story like this about a game gear or anything else<STOP><START>So what‚Äôs the story with the Viennese trench coat from the ‚Äò30s?<STOP><START>I did something similar. We were on a camping trip and I discovered a little pouch sown into the inside of the tent. I thought it was cool and the perfect place for my GBA. 

It ended up staying there, got rolled up with the tent and packed away. I searched and I searched and I searched for that damn thing. For the better part of a year. Everywhere.

For whatever reason we didn't go camping again for several years. When we did, after we set up camp and I laid down for bed my head bumped into the pouch. The memory hit me like a lightning bolt. I was simultaneously ecstatic and and furious, lol.<STOP><START>Hahahah I had a good laugh at this. Thanks! Just what a needed this evening.<STOP><START>An opening to tell a semi-relevant funny story.

My mom did this to me too, except that I knew her hiding spots. I found my game boy right away and moved the furniture in my room around so I could play in my bed and shove it under a pillow if my mom walked in. My bookshelf and desk broke the line of sight from my doorway. 

Years later I asked if she knew I had my game boy all that time, after shifting my room around. She thought for a second and it dawned on her and her response was, ‚Äúoh we just thought you learned about your dick‚Äù.<STOP><START>My ex was grounded and had his baseball cards taken away...in 1988.

"So what flavor today, doc?"<STOP><START>I‚Äôm a dentist...people have very ‚Äúcurious‚Äù tongues and I can only imagine that would be worsened by grape flavored gloves. I think your dentist needs to have a sense of humor. The days get boring without patients like you.

Edit: thank you for the silver!<STOP><START>I mean, are both of y'all single? Cuz there's worse ways to meet someone<STOP><START>Dentist here. People lick our fingers all the time. Tongues are curious. Don't sweat it, OP.

Strangest incident I had involved a patient who did, indeed, suck my fingers and tell me that I could come swim at her pool anytime, no scrubs required. I was ok with continuing to treat her until she asked if she could call me "Dr. Daddy." Now, she has a new dentist.

Edit: Thank you for the silver! My first time!<STOP><START>Just go back and explain it. "I'm sorry, your gloves were just too much like condoms."

Some of them call me ‚Äúthe Robot‚Äù and try to run/hide/play with me and sometimes this is the best part of my day.<STOP><START>When I was a kid I worshipped dinosaurs, I always wanted to be a dinosaur. I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex more than anything in the world. I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard, I chased the neighborhood cats, I growled and I roared. Everybody knew me and was afraid of me. And one day my dad said, "Pablo, you are 17. It's time to throw childish things aside," and I said, "Okay, Pop."

I used to sit on the steps that led down to the street when I was a little kid and watch them rolling up hanging off the back, hop off and load stuff, hop back on, thought it was the best job getting to ride on the back haha. I think some of my most zen moments have been working KP duty or waiting tables. Get paid more now but getting in the zone and getting things done, making things better, making customers happy etc. while physically moving and doing is some of the most... I always left the job exhausted and fulfilled in a really visceral and satisfying way. 

Edit: Oh!oh!oh! I get to do the thing! *ehem*

~~crosses it off bucket list~~<STOP><START>Nothing wrong with being a garbo. The garbos in my area (and many others) run the whole route. Damn fit.<STOP><START>This is the most wholesome thing I've read today. <STOP><START>You just don't hear about it when the garbage man jerks off in front of random women. <STOP><START>I try to keep this mentality at all times. Whenever I see a city bus, a mail carrier, a UPS/Fedex guy on the road, I always let them merge in front of me. They're out there making life better for all of us, so I tip my hat to them. Well, the invisible hat that I don't wear. <STOP><START>Hey I operate & drive a crane & I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been at a job. <STOP><START>As a truck driver this makes me smile. I would also like to add: People, find yourself a union job. Don't fall into the trap of listening to the past propaganda over the past 3 decades painting unions in a bad light. We NEED labor unions. Saying we don't need unions is like saying, "We don't need policemen because we have the law!" People do not inherently follow the law, and corporations do not inherently do the best for their employees. Unions help fight for the little guy. <STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>Knowing that like 50% of my friends (mostly female but also some guys) have been sexually harassed ( if not assaulted or even raped) and not by anyone famous, makes me think it might be as prevalent elsewhere as it is in Hollywood and were just learning about Hollywood because, well, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs famous. 

So yeah, workship regular folk if you want but don‚Äôt be surprised to learn some of them are jerks too.  <STOP><START>I‚Äôm pretty sure there are creeps in every profession and speak for yourself on worshipping Hollywood.  <STOP><START>Cesspool?  You think the garbage man, postman, the guy who drives the semis and cranes are any different?  You just don't hear about them because they're not famous.<STOP><START>As an adult, I fully admire the guys who get to operate the cranes and big machines.<STOP><START>Why? Because garbage men, postmen, deliver drivers or truck drivers never commit horrible crimes?

Humans are human, in general a bad idea and most of them are assholes. People in every line of work and every background (or vocation) do horrible things, just not all of them have a spotlight shined on them. For heavens sake, have you ever heard the expression "Going Postal".

This is one of those thoughts that sounds nice and wholesome, but examine it for a moment and it makes no sense at all.<STOP><START>True.

Another customer came in for a quote. Let's say it was $200 a month. He said he'd have to think about it, and I told him that was fine but that if he took longer than 30 days I'd have to run it again because rates vary.   

He came back in and it had been more than 30 days so I had to redo the quote. Let's say this time it was $180 a month. He was furious.   

"What!? That's not what you said before!"   

"Well, like I said before, the quote was only good for 30 days. What's more, this one is $180 and the last one was $200, so this one is less."   

"No it isn't!"

She was furious about this and laughed at me, saying ‚Äúhow can you not know? My 13 year old son read it in school! It‚Äôs a famous book, it‚Äôs by Charles Dickens!‚Äù 

I really had no idea what she was talking about and she was so angry with me she wouldn‚Äôt answer any of my questions about it (‚Äúdo you know what it‚Äôs about? Do you know any of the characters?‚Äù) just so I could figure it out for her. She just kept repeating that it‚Äôs called ‚Äúoh hello‚Äù and that everyone knows it.

They pick things up and leave them wherever they want, they take bites of food without paying and just leave the unfinished product on the shelf, they lose all ability to read signs and labels, and they just constantly are rude and have an all about me mentality. It‚Äôs very funny seeing how most customers pretended to be kind and considerate during the pandemic, but afterwards most have forgotten how to act.<STOP><START>One just can not make a statement like that and not share the stories here. So kindly please......<STOP><START>One of my favourite dickhead customers pulled me aside, in front of the meat fridges at the supermarket.

"Do you have butchers?"
"No, is there something I can help you find?"
*insert ten minute long rant about how big business has killed butchers and how dare we kill a whole profession and there's not enough range any more and why is there no sausage mince, I've been looking for it for twenty minutes!*
I stood there nodding, hmmmm-ing and just generally waiting for her to stfu, before pointing out that the sausage mince was directly in front of her, and was fully stocked.


Or the dude during peak lowdown grocery shortage season. We'd cordoned off the entirely empty meat fridges. The boss had gotten about ten of us because we actually had a pallet of chicken breast and sausages arrive (literally all the stock of meat we could get). The hungry hordes are circling and we are bustting our butts to get this shit on the shelf in the fridges before being enveloped by the rabid customers. Anyway, they basically push their way in and its obvious - Chicken or sausages. Thats it. The boss is yelling "This is all we have", numerous other employees are going "Yep, thats it, they were the only two things on the truck". And when toilet paper, rice, flour, pasta, canned vegies, milk and eggs were all also in short supply/completely unobtainable, this dude comes up to me, completely oblivious, and asks if we have any pork sirloin. Mate. No.<STOP><START>Genuinely, how people can‚Äôt work self scans when they‚Äôre just giant touch screens with scales attached to the side boggles my mind. 

People also regularly asked me if the shop I worked in was shutting for the queens funeral when it was on every window and we hand a giant person sized sign that stated we would be shut all day on it right front of the entrance. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the amount of the people that try to leave through the barrier that says ‚Äúno exit‚Äù with a big no exit sign on it then look at you with a why isn‚Äôt it working face, it‚Äôs working exactly as intended you‚Äôre just stupid.<STOP><START>I worked retail for a long time and still work in an area that is broadly customer service orientated, and my own experience is not so much that many people are stupid, but that many people are wilfully ignorant and that this takes up way more time and effort, making it look and feel like 'most people'.

Stupid can't be helped, and can often be mistaken for unfamiliarity. "What's the difference between these two TV sets?" can 'obviously' be answered with something simple like, "One is bigger than the other", but unless you hang around TVs all day, how could you expect that to be the ONLY answer without asking? When I worked in tech 10 years ago the answers were often unexpectedly simple, nowadays people just HOPE that its simple.

When someone doesn't know the answer to a seemingly simple question, asks, and is grateful for the answer - good on them. They have increased their net knowledge and I'm happy to answer easy questions all day and send them off with a smile.

But there are those who treat staff as beneath them, or demand privileges for simple walking into the building, and become haughty and irate when they're treated as merely 'normal'. Not just the ones who ask questions with supposedly obvious answers, but those that then argue with the answer they're given, or take offence because it's not the answer they were expecting to get. 

That's not stupid - that's just cruel, entitled and downright ugly. They're the ones that are the problem, and take up a disproportionate amount of time and energy to deal with that makes it FEEL like a lot more people are that way than there really are. Their attitude and sheer obnoxious affront poisons a shop assistant's mood and destroys their ability to treat others fairly and without prejudice. 

Merely not knowing something is absolutely fine, in comparison, but it's hard to remember that after 45 minutes of Karen screaming in your face about something else entirely.<STOP><START>Long ago, I worked at an electronics retailer whose name rhymes with West Eye...I was stocking shelves in the TV aisle and a customer gestured between two 24" TVs of the same brand, one had a built-in DVD player, the other didn't, and asked me, "What is the difference between these two TVs?" and I told her, "This one has a DVD player built-in, this one doesn't..." she got really indignant and stormed off...I sometimes wonder how she is doing...<STOP><START>It's not til you hand everyone in the modern world a camera and a platform to post thoughts, and pictures of themselves, you realize 85% of people are dumb.  


On a serious note, ignorance is really bliss.   
People are just not worrying too much, and that mindset can make people look stupid lol.   
Usually they can be caring and loving people:)

  
Though people do be real dumb dumb sometimes.<STOP><START>I swear people in my city are getting dumber... or maybe they're all just burned out and stuck in their own little worlds. 

Every time I drive these days, there will be at least 1 or 2 incidents where I'm left in shock and awe by the stupidity and selfishness of my fellow drivers. Just completely illogical and mindless shit people do behind the wheel.  Like everyone's in "fuck you, I'm just trying to survive the day" mode... Scary<STOP><START>Not 85% but definitely like 50%. And dumber than rocks. Rocks have the decency to just not even fucking open up a mouth.<STOP><START>During college, I worked at my university‚Äôs computer repair shop. Some incredibly smart graduate students had trouble understanding the difference between RAM and hard drives.

I‚Äôm now a lead software engineer at a fairly large company. I feel equally as clueless every time I have to bring my car in for repairs.

Every time I meet someone who seems ‚Äúdumb,‚Äù I do my best to tell myself that they‚Äôre just dumb about this one topic in particular (don‚Äôt judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree and all that).

That being said, I worked retail during high school. Some people are just dumb<STOP><START>It‚Äôs not that people are really that dumb, 85% of them just will not exercise even the most basic critical thinking without a gun to their heads. This is further enabled by dipshit customer service ideas that revolve around sucking off the customer and making sure they never have to think.<STOP><START>I've completely lost faith in the "common sense" concept. It does just not exist.<STOP><START>People seriously just don't fucking care any more. Anywhere.  About anything. The less they care, the less they will act in a manner that shows mindfulness to others. Theyll say anything to anyone with zero fear of any consequences because truthfully there aren't any. At least not consequences they care about. Not even the possibility of death is enough. They just walk around in a rose colored haze of ME ME ME, and not even their kids matter. The ones that do care are being pushed to the point where they don't care either. It really does tie in to stupidity.<STOP><START>I'm a waitress. Yesterday I had someone ask the difference between hot and iced coffee.<STOP><START>"ITS MY TITS.  DON'T LOOK."  Let me know how that works out for you.  LOL<STOP><START>Cant you unsend things on messenger now? Or is it just messages and not pictures<STOP><START>*Update: if this gets 666 upvotes I‚Äôll post the photo.*


Welp, see you on the front page.<STOP><START>I sent a gif to my fianc√©‚Äôs mother of Batman patting the bed and saying, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fuck here‚Äù 

Sort yourself out before you do something SO much worse. Lol

Edit: sorry it was Superman.<STOP><START>I once sent a picture of my cock to a group chat with my mates on accident.  Your breasts are much nicer and would have been much more appreciated.

Edit: Not my Post... I'll leave it up to the op as to applying the rules to my comment.

Edit 2: i cant believe this is my most upvoted comment on Reddit.<STOP><START>Welp, RIP OP's inbox.

&#x200B;

Nice tits though.  10/10 would sacrifice a goat on.

Edit: Thanks for the silver and gold guys!  So glad my top comment now is about some chick's chesticles.<STOP><START>My boss "What did you do at work all day?"

Me "casually refreshed Reddit for 8 hours for the slim chance to see a strangers boobs"

Edit: thank you for my first gold kind stranger, forever piggybacking my way through life.<STOP><START>There is a greater than 80 % chance he is jacking off to it now TBH.

&#x200B;

Edit: She just updated her post. OMG, 100% chance. Look at those mammaries.<STOP><START>OP actually came through and shared the pic of her tits. 

r/opdelivers<STOP><START>Congrats reddit we've done it and op delivered like a  glorious saint.

Edit: glorious sinner.

Edit2: is this what it feels like to be famous?<STOP><START>Wait I‚Äôm a little confused. Did you send it to the guy your flirting with or the mutual friend? 

Cause one might work out better than the other.<STOP><START>Damn, just flirting gets you boobs these days?<STOP><START>You went from not showing wanting to show your tits to one random dude to showing your tits to 25,000 people -- and you have identifiable tattoos...<STOP><START>You'll have to post the rest of the convo including accidental photo.
10% of it doesn't quite cut the mustard if you want us to fully understand your mortification.<STOP><START>what‚Äôs a pentagram harness..<STOP><START>"i accidentally showed someone my tits"

"hey internet, look at my tits"


i mean i aint complaining but...??<STOP><START>RIP, ashes to ashes, bust to bust.<STOP><START>I think this whole post now needs to go to r/oopsdidntmeanto<STOP><START>Nobody:

OP: I accidentally sent a tit pic that I don't want my friend to see!

Nobody:

OP: haha ok then I'll post the tit pic, that I didn't want my friend to see, on the internet for the whole world to see. OMG I hope my friend, who reads this forum, doesn't see this pic haha. Wow this is so embarrassing.<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>r/OopsDidntMeanTo<STOP><START>r/oopsdidntmeanto<STOP><START>You're devasted that you sent the picture to one friend but you're happy to share it with the entire internet (including Dan, another friend I'm guessing as "Dan" doesn't start with an M or a B) for a few hundred upvotes? 

&#x200B;

Seems odd.<STOP><START>r/oopsdidntmeanto





edit: I‚Äôm a woman as well. I have zero problem with wanting to show your nude body (she‚Äôs hot, and she knows it!) but just be forward about it rather than this painfully obvious ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to send you my boobs! Please don‚Äôt look‚Äù crap... just say ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm hot. would you like to see?‚Äù and move on<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>I came for titties. 

I saw titties. 

I came for titties!!<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>you seem like a ho trying to get attention<STOP><START>I would like Pinterest more if when you clicked on the image you didnt have to find that single photo out of a list of 1700 other related images. <STOP><START>I'd like it when they care enough about their search result usability to block Pinterest.<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>How do they get away with no copyright infringement / linking to the original picture source.

I hate their site, I made an account in hopes to further my search, but once you're there it is typically just a dead end... dude5795 pinned this photo ...where'd he get that damn photo!<STOP><START>Pintrest to me is basically a visual list of shit I want to buy but will never own because either I can't afford it ore more infuriatingly I can never find a source of where the image came from. 

"Wow, that's such an awesome leather jacket, oh, but... where can I get it? There's no source, they didn't even mention the brand name of it so I can't even search it myself. Oh well, would have probably dropped a few hundred on it in a heartbeat too but I guess I'll never buy one because I can't find the damn thing, oh wait - here's another picture of the same... oh, it's also on Pintrest. Forget it"<STOP><START>There is an addon called [Personal Blocklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef) for Chrome where you can block entire websites from your search results. I got this specifically for the most useless of all websites ever, Pinterest.<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>I still don't understand how a site can be full of public domain images (and other items converted to images like recipes, and gifs) and lock it all behind a members only wall. Also, I have Pinterest blocked, and it still shows up in top search results for just about anything I search for. <STOP><START>you know you can remove pinterest from your search results?

    searchterm -pinterest<STOP><START>Not just images. I can't search for things I said with this username without a deluge of Pinterest returns, just because I once said something moderately clever about kobolds.<STOP><START>What is Pinterest? Real question btw.<STOP><START>Pinterest is a cancer on the internet.... but damn does it have a good selection of free knitting and embroidery patterns, typically from Russian websites that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to access. <STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>Oh, plenty of people's parents disappoint them when they're still a kid.<STOP><START>You have to grow up fast when you have shitty parents.  Someone has to be the grown up.  Sometimes thats the kids.<STOP><START>I felt this.<STOP><START>You're very lucky if you were an adult before your parents ever disappointed you<STOP><START>Parents asked my wife and I to rent their house. Dad had cancer so thought his dying wish was to buy out my uncle on dead grandparents house. Also to help mom in transition. Still said no twice before I caved only because previous landlord needed to move back in. My biggest regret was not putting anything in writing, but didn't want to upset who I thought was my dying father. 

I maintained both properties the past 2 years. After Dad beat cancer a year ago, they never moved out (here 80% of time and come and go as they please), still force my uncle to pay half grandparents house expenses, and treat it like their private vacation home. Uncle won't step foot inside out of spite. I haven't spoken to uncle or cousins in over a year. I don't blame them. 

Sister acted like my wife and I are taking advantage of my parents. found out why a few months ago. Parents never told anyone we pay their mortgage and then some. both sides of mom and dads families think were freeloading. 

Mom hasn't talked to me in 7 months after I confronted her about not adhering to the agreement. Her response was "you're an asshole." Dads kicking us out now and that's fine by me. 

At least we don't have to pack. All our shit's still in boxes from 2 years ago. 

Old parents will be old parents I guess, but I'm still very disappointed in their choices and their lack of foresight. I hope one day they realize family is more important than money. 

Tl;dr parents rented out their house to wife and I, but never moved out. Disappointed is the word i use to describe this.<STOP><START>Like your parents suddenly not believing in the moon landings and taping car sun visors to their windows to block cell radiation in their 60s? Yeah it‚Äôs a bummer :(<STOP><START>Today they fought over a house that's way overvalued that my mom wants to buy so she can live in it in like 10 years. 

Her argument "I just want it!" 

She screamed at us while we ate about how nothing else mattered she just wanted it and we were ganging up on her because we don't want her to have the things she wants in life. 

I walked away like "fuck it I'm getting in my truck and never coming back here."<STOP><START>Extra points if you‚Äôre both disappointed by your parents but also an utter disappointment to your own kids<STOP><START>My mom disappointed me when she cut off my yugioh card allowance at 12.

Good for her though. Those cards were like crack.<STOP><START>[removed]<STOP><START>Right in the feels. Moved my family 3000 miles to be an hour drive  to them only to see them 4 times in a year?<STOP><START>You become an adult when you figure out your parents are normal people trying to get by.<STOP><START>I was only 5 when this happened for the first time. So I gotta disagree<STOP><START>‚ÄúWell I heard on the news that...‚Äù<STOP><START>The other day my dad showed me a video of himself with a bandana on his head and his face making ‚Äúdurka durka‚Äù noises. I have an Arab girlfriend who luckily was not there. He‚Äôs been a great dad but I was not ready for that. This one hit me right in the stomach.<STOP><START>You know you‚Äôre getting old when you realize your parents are only human and you learn to forgive them for whatever ways they messed you up in.<STOP><START>Couldn‚Äôt you just drink the holy water, and then vampires would be like, ‚ÄúEw, let‚Äôs not bite that guy?‚Äù<STOP><START>Does the opposite work as well? Can I create holy ice?<STOP><START>[deleted]<STOP><START>This is kind of why they don‚Äôt have vampires in Africa. Toto blessed the rains there.

Edit: what!?  My first reddit gold. And 3!  Thanks y‚Äôall<STOP><START>This did not work in Skyrim<STOP><START>Does this defy the Geneva Convention?<STOP><START>Quick someone notify whatever vampire show is popular now. We must see this through.<STOP><START>If that worked the whole atmosphere would already be deadly to them from 2000 years evaporated holy water.  The atmosphere mixes enough that there's a tiny bit in every breath you take.<STOP><START>Why stop there? Bless a building‚Äôs water reservoir and suddenly the sprinkler system becomes a mechanism for raining divine death on those bloodsuckers.<STOP>
